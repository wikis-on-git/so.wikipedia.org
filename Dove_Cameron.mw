I just wanted to take this time to explain my name I all of you lovelies, because I have seen that there is quite a bit of confusion. My birth name is Chloe. But my daddy called me Dove/Dovey as a nickname since I was very small; just over a year old. As some of you know, my father passed away a few years ago, right around the time I started acting. So, I decided to change it legally in honor of him, which gives me great joy every day that I was able to do something so lasting and permanent to pay homage to his memory. But I still go by Chloe to some family members and Ryan. And some Starbucks employees. So Dove is not a stage name, it's actually a name that means a lot to me for many reasons. I Love you all!|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085603/http://instagram.com/p/r3IzUzpBlW/|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=DoveCameron|last=Cameron|first=Dove|number=224984773699969025|date=July 16, 2012|title=@sharebear72 Thank you, lovely!
