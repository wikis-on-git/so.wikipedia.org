 very interested about gemstones especially for their great beauty ,  perfection and also an economic entity.Im also a second year student of mineralogy in geology department , in helsinki university , Finland...(where I lived for almost 14yrs ).

I am from a country which has no central government authority for 14 years, no national currency, no taxation nor any minning fasicility. That could  make a hard to my business intention (s) .I visit there several times (y 98-04) , taking also a (ruby , emerald...etc.) samples from there.The are has alots of  unexploited deposits of anhydrite, bauxite, columbite, feldspar, natural gas, iron ore, kaolin, quartz, silica sand, tantalum, thorium, tin, and uranium, and recent discoveries of amethyst, aquamarine, emerald, garnet, opal, ruby, and sapphire. Mining of the gemstones in there, has been limited by a lack of modern equipment, civil strife, and damage to the infrastructure; recently private -funded non-governmental businessÂ´s  was working with the cities to exploit gemstone resources.Thats why im interesting of involving gemstones now and in the future. Althought I am  young (under 30), I am very much interested of making  partners that are also interested about this particular issue. So if someone or anyone want to make a money from gemstones , please contact me or forward this text.

P.S. I know that , this text is not fully understandable but I am real.It would be a very kind to have even , a some kind of answer
