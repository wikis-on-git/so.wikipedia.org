The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas (p√®re) in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. Another important work by Dumas, written before his work with Maquet, was the short novel "Georges"; This novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices later in The Count of Monte Cristo.

The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: France's Louis-Philippe reigns through the Bourbon Restoration era. It starts just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a basic element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It's centered on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from prison, gets a fortune, and his imprisonment for the intimidation of the assassination. His plans have been devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty.
The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, "The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as incible and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood."
