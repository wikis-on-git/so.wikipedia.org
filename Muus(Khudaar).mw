'''Banana''' is the [[common name]] for [[herbaceous plant]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' and for the [[fruit]] they produce. Bananas come in a variety of sizes and [[color]]s when ripe, including yellow, purple, and red.

Almost all modern edible [[Parthenocarpy|parthenocarpic]] bananas come from the two wild species – ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of bananas are '''''Musa acuminata''''', '''''Musa balbisiana''''' or hybrids '''''Musa acuminata × balbisiana''''', depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific names ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' are no longer used.

Banana is also used to describe [[Ensete|Enset]] and [[Fe'i banana]]s, neither of which belong to the aforementioned species. Enset bananas belong to the genus ''Ensete'' while the [[taxonomy]] of Fe'i-type [[cultivar]]s is uncertain.

In [[popular culture]] and [[commerce]], "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet "dessert" bananas. By contrast, [[Banana Cultivar Groups|''Musa'' cultivar]]s with firmer, starchier fruit are called [[plantain]]s or "cooking bananas". The distinction is purely arbitrary and the terms "plantain" and "banana" are sometimes interchangeable depending on their usage.

They are native to tropical [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and are likely to have been first domesticated in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name="apscience">{{cite web |title = Tracing antiquity of banana cultivation in Papua New Guinea |publisher = The Australia & Pacific Science Foundation |url =http://apscience.org.au/projects/PBF_02_3/pbf_02_3.htm |accessdate = 2007-09-18}}</ref> Today, they are cultivated throughout the [[tropics]].<ref>[http://agroforestry.net/tti/Musa-banana-plantain.pdf Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry, ''Musa'' species (banana and plantain)]. agroforestry.net</ref> They are grown in at least 107 [[Country|countries]],<ref name="fao">{{cite web |title = FAOSTAT: ProdSTAT: Crops |publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year = 2005 |url = http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 |accessdate =2006-12-09}}</ref> primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make [[fiber]], [[banana wine]] and as [[ornamental plant]]s.
