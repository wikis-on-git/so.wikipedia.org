[[Epithelial cell junction ]]

Specialized structures found in epithelia that bind 

Individual cell together in unity and function 
Function unit and the adhesion of the extracellular matrix of the cell membrane 

Protein 


[[3 There is a type of cell juction ]]
[[1 - the intersection of occlusion (impermeable barrier) ]]
[[- Establishing the intersection of (mechanical strength) ]]
[[3 - the intersection of communications (the movement of the cell) ]]


[[Occluding junction ]]

To maintain intégrité of epithelial cells as a barrier 
Function of occlusion injection 
[[1 - prevent the spread of molecules between adjacent cells ]]
[[2 - To prevent migration of the cell membran protein ]]
[[3-Prevention digested three molecules from passing between the cells ]]

[[desmosomes ]]
Grams. [[desmos, and the band, + soma, body]]), or stuck to the spot. Who is the desmosome 

A complex structure in the form of a disk on the surface of a single cell that 

Matched with a similar structure on the surface of the adjacent cell 

Desmosomes very characteristic of epithelial cells that have 

Revealed a tumor in the uncertain nature indicate the presence of 

Epithelial lymphocytes in exchange for support or the parent cell 

Palace. Particulatry advanced squamous epithial class

CJ (GAP j) diffuse selectively allow molecules between adjacent cells. 
 (J gap) is important in heart muscle cells and smooth where 

Pass the signals involved in the contraction of one cell to another 


Anchors the basement membrane of epithelial cells of the tissue underlying 
BM:. This membrane, which is located at the base of epithelial formed additional 

Cellululer protein called type VI collagen matrix prepared by the 

Epithelial cell 


Specializations of the cell surface 
Free or apical surface of many types of epithelial cells containing 

Specialized structures that increase the surface area of the cell or the transfer of 

Materials or particles stuck to the epithelium. 
vil mic, plaques basolateral times, and the membrane 

[[Microvilli ]]
When viewed in the electron microscope, the majority of cells 

Perceived by many different tissues to the expectations of cytoplasmic. 

Some of these expectations is that the folds follow the zigzag path 

Present mainly on the surfaces of the cell side (Figure 4-4). Other 

Expectations, and microvilli (mikros Gr. Small, + L. villus, tuft of 

Hair), and accessories for measuring the fingers of about [[1 meter high and 0.08 m 

Widely]]. They are found mainly on the surface of the cell free. 

Was found on hundreds of cells in the microvilli of absorptive, such as 

Epithelium lining the small intestine and cells of the nearby 

Renal tubule 
And maintain shap of mic.v by a package of yarn actin 


Basolateral folds increase the surface area of the cell 
Basolateral folds are deep invaginations of the basal or lateral 

Surface of cells 
High concentration of mitochondria, which provide the energy needed for 

Ion and fluid transport 


[[Membrane plaques ]]
Plaques rigid membrane regions of the cell membrane and found only apical 

In the epithelium lining the urinary tract. 
And can fold down into the cell when the bladder is empty and unfold 

Amaip to increase the area of the cell when the fullness of the bladder 


Cilia are projections of a moving surface of cells involved in transport 
Hair and hair-like projection,[[ 0.2μm in diameter]], which arise from 

The surface of specialized cells and have a certain role in the transfer of fluids 

On the cell surface or to give the cell kinetics 


Secretory conditioning 
Be of some epithelial cells of specialization related to structural 

And its role in the production and secretion of molecules, such as 

Enzymes, mucins and steroids 


Epithelial cells secrete the protein, and large nuclei and abundant raw 

List 
And certain specialized cells to secrete the protein and its producer 

The following characteristics:

Epithelial cell mucin, secretion system has greatly expanded Golgi 
Mucins an important function in the body cavities, for example as 

Lubricating oils in the mouth and a barrier in the stomach. 
Characterized by cells that produce and secrete mucin, including the following 

Features: 
     List of basal sophisticated raw 
     The supranuclear Golgi advanced 
For example, in the epithelia lining the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory system 
In addition, it can be grouped cells secretion of mucin, a specialist in 

Glands, for example in the genital tract, and respiratory 

Intestinal tract 


Epithelial cells have steroid secretion in a smooth and widespread 

System of endoplasmic reticulum 
Was found on the cells producing mainly steroid hormones in the adrenal gland, 

Ovary and testis, and has the following properties: 
      Er sophisticated smooth 
      Fat Free 
      Prominent mitochondria 


Ion pump epithelial cells and mitochondria are many and large surface 

Region

E transport ions ⁺ 
And ion transport mediated by membrane ion pumps: Use this as an ATP 

Source of energy for the exchange of ions between the cytosol and 

Extracellular space
