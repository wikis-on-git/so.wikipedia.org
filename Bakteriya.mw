[[human physiology]]

Define: human physiology is a science which analysis the body function and their interaction with environments.
In so doing, we seek to understand the mechanism whereby these interactions take place 

The study of human physiology is an essential prerequisite to the practice of preventive and curative medicine 
Human as alive organism, are influenced by the environment in which they life.


[[Component of external environments ]]


1-Chemical: food, water, O2, CO2, drugs .etc.
2-Physical: heat, light, sound, motion, and radiation  
3-psychosocial environment: beliefs
4-Biological: Microorganism, parasites


[[contact systems]]


a) Respiratory system: it contact with atmospheric air
b) Digestive system: it contact with food and drink.
 c) Sensory organism: help us to hear, sea, smell or taste,
 d) Skin direct contact the sense of object material temperature


[[The control system]]


Control system: to adjust to the changes, which takes place the external environment, many detectors and sensory mechanisms are involved .these send messages to the systems responsible for control of body functions 


[[The control system is divided in to:]]


[[1-]]Nerves system: 
Somatic 
Autonomic 


[[2-Endocrine gland]].

Together or singly, they provide the mechanism of communication and adjustment of the internal environment 


The nervous system works by means of electrical signals, which drivel in the nerves, and the endocrine gland release hormones, which are transported in the blood to the target organs


[[Internal environment]]


the human body, like other complex lives organisms consist of organs and tissue, which in turn, are made up of cells. The smallest unit of life in this complex structure is the cell 
The function of all the organs of the body is to ensure that the physical and chemical characteristics of the tissue fluid remain constant within narrow limits.


 [[Adaptation  ]]

Adaptation is concerned long term adjustment required for normal life 
Adaptation is unlike homeostasis 
Adaptation to the environment can be considered success full when the relationship of human individual or community is in a state of place and productivity.


[[Example]]


[[1-]]Physical adaptations are seen in the body shape, body composition and skin colure of people who live under different climate condition
Cold climates favour deposition of fat, short stature and white skin e.g. (the Inuit of north Canada).


Hot climate favour a lean and tall body frame as well as the formation of protection pigment in the skin e.g.( like dinka of southern Sudan and the masai of Kenya )the density of skin pigment varies directly with the amount of sunshine and protect the body from harmful excess of ultraviolet rays.


[[2)]] Physiological adaptations: which maintain body functions under extremes of environmental conditions. For instance, people living at high attitude make more red blood cells and Hemoglobin so as to be able to live and work at lower pressure. Similarly, people living in cold environments increase the thyroid function so as to generate more heat in the body through a higher rate of metabolism. 


[[3) ]] Psychosocial adaptation: takes place under variety of conditions. People who migrate to deferent countries will acquire behavior and habits more acceptable to the new society.
     marriage is an excellent example where each of the partners adjusts to the attitude and behavior of the other so as to build a home and to rain a family
