[[Bacteria]] are ubiquitous in every habitat on Earth, growing in soil, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[2] water, and deep in the Earth's crust, as well as in organic matter and the live bodies of plants and animals.

 There are typically [[40 million]] bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a [[million]] bacterial cells in a [[millilitre]] of fresh water; in all, there are approximately [[five]] nonillion [[(5×1030)]] bacteria on Earth,[3] forming much of the world's biomass.[3] [[Bacteria]] are vital in recycling nutrients, with many steps in nutrient cycles depending on these organisms, such as the fixation of [[]]nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction.

However, most [[bacteria]] have not been characterised, and only about half of the phyla of [[bacteria]] have species that can be grown in the laboratory.[4] The study of bacteria is known as [[bacteriology]], a branch of [[microbiology]].

However, a few species of [[bacteria]] are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including [[cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy and bubonic plague]]. The most common fatal [[bacterial diseases]] are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about [[2 million]] people a year, mostly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

[6] In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat [[bacterial]] infections and in agriculture, so antibiotic resistance is becoming common. In industry, [[bacteria]] are important in sewage treatment, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.[7]

Once regarded as plants constituting the Class Schizomycetes, [[bacteria]] are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a [[nucleus]] and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles.

Although the term bacteria traditionally included [[all prokaryotes]], the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the [[1990]] that [[prokaryotes]] consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called [[Bacteria and Archaea]].[8]

[[Bacterial cells]] are about [[one ten]] the size of [[eukaryotic cells ]]and are typically [[0.5–5.0 micrometres in length]]. However, a few species–for example [[Thiomargarita namibiensis and Epulopiscium fishelsoni–are up to half a millimetre long ]]and are visible to the unaided eye.[31] Among the [[smallest bacteria]] are members of the genus [[Mycoplasma]], which measure only [[0.3 micrometres]], as small as the largest viruses.[32] Some [[bacteria]] may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.[33]

Most bacterial species are either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek κόκκος-kókkos, grain, seed) or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation is associated with swimming.[34] Some rod-shaped bacteria, called vibrio, are slightly curved or comma-shaped; others, can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes.[35] More recently, bacteria were discovered deep under the Earth's crust that grow as long rods with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments.[36] This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.[37][38]

Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: Neisseria form diploids (pairs), Streptococcus form chains, and Staphylococcus group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments, for example the Actinobacteria. Filamentous bacteria are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells. Certain types, such as species of the genus Nocardia, even form complex, branched filaments, similar in appearance to fungal mycelia.

*                                                        [[Cholera]] 

Cholera is an infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Transmission is primarily through contaminated drinking water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Primary treatment is with oral or intravenous rehydration solutions. Antibiotics may be beneficial, and in certain cases they are used. Cholera is a major cause of death in the world. Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by epidemiological methods.


 
                                                      [[Signs and symptoms]]

The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea, dehydration, abdominal pain, and fever. Cholera may also cause blue skin and dehydration. A person infected with cholera may not always have these symptoms or any at all. Cholera may also cause vomiting. These symptoms start suddenly, usually one to five days after infection, and are the result of a toxin produced by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium that compels profuse amounts of fluid from the blood supply into the small and large intestines.[1] An untreated cholera person may produce around 10 liters of diarrhoeal fluid a day.


                                                      [[ Cause]]

Main article: Vibrio cholerae
 
TEM image of Vibrio choleraeCholera is caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Most bacteria when consumed do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach.[2] The few bacteria that do survive conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they need to propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal wall where they can thrive. V. cholerae bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein flagellin to make flagella, the curly whip-like tails that they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus of the small intestine.

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they do not need the flagella propellers to move any longer. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin, thus again conserving energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they manufacture in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.

The cholera toxin (CTX or CT) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6).[3] Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to secretion of H2O, Na+, K+, Cl−, and HCO3− into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin is introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of lysogenic bacteriophage called CTXf or CTXφ.

 
Cholera Toxin. The delivery region (blue) binds membrane carbohydrates to get into cells. The toxic part (red) is activated inside the cell (PDB code: 1xtc).Microbiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.[4] Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.

By inserting separate, successive sections of V. cholerae DNA into the DNA of other bacteria such as E. coli that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which V. cholerae responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered that there is a complex cascade of regulatory proteins that control expression of V. cholerae virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the V. cholerae bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins that cause diarrhea in the infected person and that permit the bacteria to colonize the intestine.[4] Current research aims at discovering "the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine."[4]

                                                    [[ Pathophysiology]]

Recent epidemiologic research suggests that an individual's susceptibility to cholera (and other diarrhoeal infections) is affected by their blood type: those with type O blood are the most susceptible,[5][6] while those with type AB are the most resistant. Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B.[citation needed]

About one million V. cholerae bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in normally healthy adults, although increased susceptibility may be observed in those with a weakened immune system, individuals with decreased gastric acidity (as from the use of antacids), or those who are malnourished.

It has also been hypothesized that the cystic fibrosis genetic mutation has been maintained in humans due to a selective advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to V. cholerae infections.[7] In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the gastrointestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.

                                                    [[ Transmission]]
 
Drawing of Death bringing the cholera, in Le Petit JournalPeople infected with cholera suffer acute diarrhoea. This highly liquid diarrhoea, colloquially referred to as "rice-water stool," is loaded with bacteria that can infect water used by other people.[8] Cholera is transmitted through ingestion of water contaminated with the cholera bacterium, usually from feces or other effluent. The source of the contamination is typically other cholera patients when their untreated diarrhoea discharge is allowed to get into waterways or into groundwater or drinking water supplies. Any infected water and any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person. V. cholerae harbours naturally in the zooplankton of fresh,[citation needed] brackish,[9] and salt water,[9] attached primarily to their chitinous exoskeleton.[10] Both toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a lysogenic bacteriophage.[11] Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow zooplankton blooms, thus making cholera a zoonotic disease.

                                           [[ Human contribution to transmissibility]]

Cholera bacteria grown in vitro encounter difficulty subsequently growing in humans without additional stomach acid buffering. In a 2002 study at Tufts University School of Medicine, it was found that stomach acidity is a principal agent that advances epidemic spread.[12] In their findings, the researchers found that human colonization creates a hyperinfectious bacterial state that is maintained after dissemination and that may contribute to epidemic spread of the disease. When these hyperinfectious bacteria underwent transcription profiles, they were found to possess a unique physiological and behavioural state, characterized by high expression levels of genes required for nutrient acquisition and motility, and low expression levels of genes required for bacterial chemotaxis. Thus, the spread of cholera can be expedited by host physiology.

                                                 [[ Diagnosis]]

In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis is made by taking a history of symptoms from the patient and by a brief examination only. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis of specimens.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is Vibrio cholerae O1. If V. cholerae serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory. Infection with V. cholerae O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by V. cholerae O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported.[13]

A number of special media have been employed for the cultivation for cholera vibrios. They are classified as follows:

                                              [[ Enrichment media]]
Alkaline peptone water at pH 8.6 
Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water at pH 9.2 
[edit] Plating media
Alkaline bile salt agar (BSA): The colonies are very similar to those on nutrient agar. 
Monsur's gelatin Tauro cholate trypticase tellurite agar (GTTA) medium: Cholera vibrios produce small translucent colonies with a greyish black centre. 
TCBS medium: This the mostly widely used medium. This medium contains thiosulphate, citrate, bile salts and sucrose. Cholera vibrios produce flat 2–3 mm in diameter, yellow nucleated colonies. 
Direct microscopy of stool is not recommended as it is unreliable. Microscopy is preferred only after enrichment, as this process reveals the characteristic motility of Vibrios and its inhibition by appropriate antiserum. Diagnosis can be confirmed as well as serotyping done by agglutination with specific sera.

                                                 [[Prevention]]
 
Cholera hospital in Dhaka, showing typical cholera beds.Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices, cholera is no longer a major health threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910-1911.[14][15] Travellers should be aware of how the disease is transmitted and what can be done to prevent it. Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be (and should be) halted:

Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of infected faecal waste water produced by cholera victims and all contaminated materials (e.g. clothing, bedding, etc.) is essential. All materials that come in contact with cholera patients should be sterilized by washing in hot water using chlorine bleach if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective anti-microbial agents. 
Sewage: anti-bacterial treatment of general sewage by chlorine, ozone, ultra-violet light or other effective treatment before it enters the waterways or underground water supplies helps prevent undiagnosed patients from inadvertently spreading the disease. 
Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to decontaminate the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use. 
Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, ultra-violet light sterilization (e.g. by solar water disinfection), or anti-microbial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better anti-microbial filters like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases. 

                                                   [[ Surveillance]]

Sensitive surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provide guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable. This will also aid in the developing indicators for appropriate use of oral cholera vaccine.[16]

                                                      [[ Vaccine]]

A number of safe and effective vaccines for cholera are available.[17] One injectable vaccine is effective for 2-3 years.[17] An orally administered inactivated whole cell vaccine against cholera (Dukoral) has an efficacy of 85% with minimal side effects.[18] Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination.[19] Dukoral is avaliable in over 60 countries however is not currently recommended for most travelers by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[20]                                                                               
                                                       [[ Treatment]]
 
Cholera patient being treated by medical staff in 1992.In most cases cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy (ORT). ORT is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer: prompt replacement of water and electrolytes is the principal treatment for cholera, as dehydration and electrolyte depletion occur rapidly. In situations where commercially produced ORT sachets are too expensive or difficult to obtain, alternative homemade solutions are available. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 8 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.[21] These methods, which use various formulas containing water, sugar, table salt, baking soda, and fruit offer less expensive methods of electrolyte repletion. In severe cholera cases with significant dehydration, the administration of intravenous rehydration solutions may be necessary.

Antibiotics shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms; however, oral rehydration therapy remains the principal treatment. Tetracycline is typically used as the primary antibiotic, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance. Other antibiotics that have been proven effective against V. cholerae include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone.[22] Fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin also may be used, but resistance has been reported.[23]

Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi-drug resistant V. cholerae.[24] New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against V. cholerae in in vitro studies.[25]

The success of treatment is significantly affected by the speed and method of treatment. If cholera patients are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50–60%.[26][27]                                                        

                                                   [[ Epidemiology]]

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a reservoir and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century and seems likely to persist.[28]

                                                   [[ Notable outbreaks]]

August 2008 - April 2009: In the 2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak, which is still continuing, an estimated 96,591 people in the country have been infected with cholera and, by 16 April 2009, 4,201 deaths had been reported.[35] According to the World Health Organization, during the week of 22–28 March 2009, the "Crude Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)" had dropped from 4.2% to 3.7%.[35] The daily updates for the period 29 March 2009 to 7 April 2009, list 1748 cases and 64 fatalities, giving a weekly CFR of 3.66% (see table above);[36] however, those for the period 8 April to 16 April list 1375 new cases and 62 deaths (and a resulting CFR of 4.5%).[36] The CFR had remained above 4.7% for most of January and early February 2009.[37] 
January 2009 - The Mpumalanga province of South Africa has confirmed over 381 new cases of Cholera, bringing the total number of cases treated since November 2008 to 2276. 19 people have died in the province since the outbreak.[38] 
August 2010 - Nigeria is reaching epidemic proportions after wide spread confirmation of the Cholera outbreaks in 12 of its 36 states. 6400 cases have been reported with 352 reported deaths. The health ministry blamed the outbreak on heavy seasonal rainfall and poor sanitation.[39] 
October 2010 - The 2010 Haitian cholera outbreak in the rural Artibonite region, killing at least 337 and infecting more than 4,700. The outbreak has been attributed to widespread homelessness following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, forcing people to drink from the local rivers.[40] 
[edit] Pandemic genetic diversity
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of Vibrio cholerae has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II.
