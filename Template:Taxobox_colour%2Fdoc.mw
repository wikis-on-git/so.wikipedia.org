{{Taxobox colour scheme}}

== Function ==
This template generates the appropriate colour for a taxobox, as advised at [[WP:TX]].

It should be supplied with the kingdom (regnum), appropriately wikilinked; in the case of regnum-less viruses, the virus group may be supplied instead.

== Maintenance ==
Edits to the taxonomic terms used in this template must be reflected by [[Template:is reg]].
