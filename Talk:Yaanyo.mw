== WikiData item ==

The article for [[:en:Tomato]] is on WikiMedia's "expanded list of articles every Wikipedia should have."

However, some users at WikiData such as [[User:Brya]] have made a separate item for language articles that seem like stubs on the assumption they are a separate topic.

These stub articles link only to each other, making it harder to link to real information about Tomato.

They also don't get counted by the automated programs as existing for "articles every wikipedia should have."

I am sure the users of this wiki intended to have an article about Tomato corresponding with the high quality articles and the "should have list".

But so far admins and bureaucrats at wikidata have backed up User Brya and keeping the languages segregated and have opposed me pointing this out.

If you can put in a word [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Reporting_a_personal_attack_.28again.29 here] about how you feel it might help!
