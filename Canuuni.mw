The '''atemoya''', '''''Annona × atemoya''''', is a hybrid of two [[Miro|fruits]] &#x2013; the sugar-apple (''Annona squamosa'') and the cherimoya (''A. cherimola'') &#x2013; which are both native to the American tropics.<ref>{{Template:Cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles R.|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|page=26}}</ref>  This fruit is popular in [[Taywan|Taiwan]], where it is known as the "pineapple sugar apple" (鳳梨釋迦), so is sometimes wrongly believed to be a cross between the sugar-apple and the [[Cananis|pineapple]]. In [[Kuuba|Cuba]], this fruit is called ''anón'', and in [[Fanansuwela|Venezuela]] ''chirimorinon''. In Palestine and [[Lubnaan|Lebanon]], the fruit is called ''achta''.  This is different from the Achta that is used in many Lebanese desserts, including ice cream, which is actually the skimming of fresh milk or cream.
