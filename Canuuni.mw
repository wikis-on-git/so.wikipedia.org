'''''Annona''''' is a genus of flowering plants in the pawpaw/sugar apple family, Annonaceae. It is the second largest genus in the family after ''Guatteria'', containing approximately 166 species of mostly neotropical and afrotropical [[Geed|trees]] and shrubs.
The generic name derives from ''anón'', a Hispaniolan Taíno word for the fruit. Paleoethnobotanical studies have dated ''Annona'' exploitation and cultivation in the Yautepec River region of [[Meksiko|Mexico]] to approximately 1000 BC. It has several common names, including Guanabana, [http://www.graviolafruitsecrets.com/2015/10/graviola-fruit.html Graviola] and Soursop.
