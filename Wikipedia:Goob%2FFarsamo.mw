== Developer Wishlist Survey: propose your ideas ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

At the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Developer_Summit Wikimedia Developer Summit], we decided to organize a Developer Wishlist Survey, and here we go:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Developer_Wishlist

The Wikimedia technical community seeks input from developers for
developers, to create a high-profile list of desired improvements. The scope of the survey includes the MediaWiki platform (core software, APIs, developer environment, enablers for extensions, gadgets, templates, bots, dumps), the Wikimedia server infrastructure, the contribution process, and documentation.

The best part: we want to have the results published by Wednesday, February 15. Yes, in a month, to have a higher chance to influence the
Wikimedia Foundation annual plan FY 2017-18.

There's no time to lose. <b>Propose your ideas before the end of January</b>, 
either by pushing existing tasks in Phabricator or by creating new ones. You can find instructions on the wiki page. Questions and feedback are welcome especially on the related Talk page.

The voting phase is expected to start on February 6 (tentative). Watch this space (or even better, the wiki page) - [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:SSethi_(WMF) SSethi_(WMF)] January 21st, 2017 3:07 AM (UTC) </div>

== New notification when a page is connected to Wikidata ==

Hello all,

''({{Int:Please-translate}})''

The Wikidata development team is about to deploy a new feature on all Wikipedias. It is a new type of notification (via Echo, the notification system you see at the top right of your wiki when you are logged in), that will inform the creator of a page, when this page is connected to a Wikidata item.

You may know that [[d:Wikidata:Main page|Wikidata]] provides a centralized system for all the interwikilinks. When a new page is created, it should be connected to the corresponding Wikidata item, by modifying this Wikidata item. With this new notification, editors creating pages will be informed when another editor connects this page to Wikidata.

[[File:Screenshot Echo Wikibase notification.png]]

This feature will be deployed on May 30th on all the Wikipedias, excepting English, French and German. This feature will be disable by default for existing editors, and enabled by default for new editors.

This is the first step of the deployments, the Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects will follow in the next months.

If you have any question, suggestion, please let me know by pinging me. You can also follow and leave a comment [[phab:T142102|on the Phabricator ticket]].

Thanks go to [[d:user:Matěj Suchánek|Matěj Suchánek]] who developed this feature!

== Improvements coming soon to Recent Changes ==

<div dir="ltr">
[[File:Rc-beta-tour-welcome-ltr.gif|link=Mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New_filters_for_edit_review|right|frameless]]
Hello

Sorry to use English. {{Int:please-translate}}! {{Int:thank-you}}

'''In short:''' starting on 26 September, New Filters for Edit Review ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|now in Beta]]) will become standard on Recent Changes. They provide an array of new tools and an improved interface. If you prefer the current page you will be able to opt out. [[mw:Edit Review Improvements/New filters for edit review|Learn more about the New Filters]].

<big>'''What is this feature again?'''</big>

This feature improves [[Special:RecentChanges]] and [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]] (and soon, [[Special:Watchlist]] – see below). 

Based on a new design, it adds new features that ease vandalism tracking and support of newcomers:
* [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New filters for edit review/Filtering|Filtering]] - filter recent changes with easy-to-use and powerful filters combinations, including filtering by namespace or tagged edits.
* [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New filters for edit review/Highlighting function|Highlighting]] - add a colored background to the different changes you are monitoring. It helps quick identification of changes that matter to you.
* [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New filters for edit review/Bookmarking|Bookmarking]] to keep your favorite configurations of filters ready to be used.
* [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New filters for edit review/Quality and Intent Filters|Quality and Intent Filters]] - those filters use [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/ORES|ORES predictions]]. They identify real vandalism or good faith intent contributions that need help. They are not available on all wikis. 
You can know more about this project by visiting [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:New filters for edit review/Quick tour|the quick tour help page]].

<big>'''Concerning RecentChanges'''</big>

Starting on 26 September, '''New Filters for Edit Review will become standard on Recent Changes'''. We have decided to do this release because of a long and successful Beta test phase, positive feedback from various users and positive user testing. 

Some features will remain as Beta features and will be added later. [[mw:Edit Review Improvements/New filters for edit review|Learn more about those different features]].

If your community has specific concerns about this deployment or internal discussion, it can request to have the deployment to their wikis delayed to October 1, if they have ''sensible, consistent with the project, actionable, realistic feedback to oppose'' (at the development team's appreciation). 

You will also be able to opt-out this change in your preferences. 

<big>'''Concerning Watchlists'''</big>

Starting on '''September 19''', the Beta feature will have a new option. '''Watchlists will have all filters available now on the Beta Recent Changes improvements'''.

If you have already activated the Beta feature "{{int:eri-rcfilters-beta-label}}", you have no action to take. If you haven't activated the Beta feature "{{int:eri-rcfilters-beta-label}}" and you want to try the filters on Watchlists, please go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|your Beta preferences]] on September 19.  

<big>'''How to be ready'''</big>

Please share this announcement!

Do you use Gadgets that change things on your RecentChanges or Watchlist pages, or have you customized them with scripts or CSS? You may have to make some changes to your configuration. Despite the fact that we have tried to take most cases into consideration, some configurations may break. The Beta phase is a great opportunity to have a look at local scripts and gadgets: some of them may be replaced by native features from the Beta feature.

Please ping me if you have questions.

== We need your feedback to improve Lua functions ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello,

(I’m sorry for writing in English. {{Int:Please-translate}})

If you’re regularly using Lua modules, creating and improving some of them, we need your feedback!

The Wikidata development team would like to provide more Lua functions, in order to improve the experience of people who write Lua scripts to reuse Wikidata's data on the Wikimedia projects. Our goals are to help harmonizing the existing modules across the Wikimedia projects, to make coding in Lua easier for the communities, and to improve the performance of the modules.

We would like to know more about your habits, your needs, and what could help you. We have a few questions for you [[d:Wikidata:New convenience functions for Lua|on this page]]. Note that if you don’t feel comfortable with writing in English, you can answer in your preferred language.

== Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias'''

{{int:please-translate}}

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Extension:Kartographer|Mapframe]] is a feature that enables users to easily display interactive maps right on wiki pages. Currently, most Wikipedias don’t have mapframe. But [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Maps#Milestones_and_Updates|fifteen Wikipedias]], along with all the other Wikimedia projects, are using mapframe today to display maps on thousands of pages.

A little background: over the last few months, the Foundation’s [[mw:Collaboration|Collaboration team]] has been working to improve the stability and user experience of the maps service. In addition, a question about long-term support for the maps service was recently settled, and a small team has been assigned for routine maintenance. Given these developments, bringing the benefits of mapframe to Wikipedias that lack the feature seems both safe and supportable. [[phab:T191583|Nine Wikipedias]] that use a stricter version of Flagged Revisions will not get mapframe in this release.

Maps are a valuable form of visual data that can improve readers’ understanding across a wide range of topics. If you know of any reasons why mapframe shouldn’t be implemented on your Wikipedia, let us know [[mw:Talk:Map_improvements_2018|on the project talk page]]. Unless we hear from you, we plan to release mapframe to most Wikipedias in May, 2018. So, if you foresee an issue, please let us hear from you. Otherwise, happy mapping!

In particular, tell us if you know of a special incompatibility or other issue that makes the New Filters problematic on your wiki. We’ll examine the blocker and may delay release on your wiki until the issue can be addressed.

The deployment will start on June 18 or on June 25, depending on the wiki ([[phab:T195993#4261642|check the list]]). After the deployment, you will also be able to opt-out this change directly from the Watchlist page and also in your preferences.

== Update on page issues on mobile web ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Update on page issues on mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
Hi everyone. The [[mw:Reading/Web/Team|Readers web team]] has recently begun working on exposing issue templates on the mobile website. Currently, details about issues with page content are generally hidden on the mobile website. This leaves readers unaware of the reliability of the pages they are reading. The goal of this project is to improve awareness of particular issues within an article on the mobile web. We will do this by changing the visual styling of page issues.

So far, we have [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|drafted a proposal on the design and implementation]] of the project.  We were also able to run [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues/Research Results|user testing on the proposed designs]].  The tests so far have positive results. Here is a quick summary of what we learned:
* The new treatment increases awareness of page issues among participants. This is true particularly when they are in a more evaluative/critical mode.
* Page issues make sense to readers and they understand how they work
* Readers care about page issues and consider them important
* Readers had overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Wikipedia associated with learning about page issues
Our next step would be to start implementing these changes. We wanted to reach out to you for any concerns, thoughts, and suggestions you might have before beginning development. Please [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|visit the project page]] where we have more information and mockups of how this may look. Please [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|leave feedback on the talk page]].

== Consultation on the creation of a separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all,

I'm preparing a change in who can edit sitewide CSS/JS pages. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which are executed in the browser of all readers and editors.) Currently all administrators are able to edit these pages, which poses a serious and unnecessary security risk. Soon, a dedicated, smaller user group will take over this task. Your community will be able to decide who belongs in this group, so this should mean very little change for you. You can find out more and provide feedback at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|the consultation page on Meta]]. If you are involved in maintaining CSS/JS code, or policymaking around adminship requests, please give it a look!

Thanks!

== Enabling a helpful feature for Template editors ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello.

The team working on TemplateStyles at the Wikimedia Foundation would like to enable TemplateStyles on this wiki.

TemplateStyles is a feature to allow non-administrators to write and manage CSS styles for templates. It allows contributors who edit templates to separate content and presentation. A good web practice that makes it easier to manage the layout of templates. If you don't edit templates, this will not have any impact on your contributions. 

TemplateStyles is useful for a few reasons. 

* It makes it possible for templates to work better on mobile.
* It cuts out confusion on where to apply CSS rules.
* Editing CSS is currently limited to administrators, which is a major barrier to participation.
* All stylesheets must be loaded on all pages (whether they actually use the page or not), which wastes bandwidth and makes debugging style rules more difficult.
You can [[mw:Help:TemplateStyles|learn more about TemplateStyles on MediaWiki.org]]. [[mw:Extension:TemplateStyles|Technical documentation is also available]].

This is an optional feature and no one must use it, but template contributors are encouraged to do so! Please discuss and let us know if there are any concerns. If there are no concerns we will proceed to deploy the feature on the 9th of August.

Thank you.

== Wikidata Bridge: edit Wikidata’s data from Wikipedia infoboxes ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for writing this message in English - feel free to help us translating it :)''

Hello all,

Many language versions of Wikipedia use the content of [[Wikidata]], the centralized knowledge base, to fill out the content of infoboxes. The data is stored in Wikidata and displayed, partially or completely, in the Wikipedia’s language, on the articles.
This feature is used by many template editors, but brought several issues that were raised by communities in various places: not being able to edit the data directly from Wikipedia was one of them.

This is the reason why the '''[[mw:Wikidata Bridge|Wikidata Bridge]]''' project started, with the goal of offering a way to Wikipedia editors to edit Wikidata’s data more easily. This will be achieved by an interface, connected to the infobox, that users can access directly from their local wiki. 

The project is now at an early stage of development. A lot of [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge/Research|user research]] has been done, and will continue to be done through the different phases of the project. The next steps of [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge/Development|development]] will be achieved by the development team working at Wikimedia Deutschland, starting now until the end of 2019.

In order to make sure that we’re building a tool that is answering editors’ needs, we’re using agile methods in our development process. We don’t start with a fixed idea of the tool we want to deliver: we will build it together with the editors, based on feedback loops that we will regularly organize. The first version will not necessarily have all of the features you want, but it will keep evolving.

Here’s the planned timeline:
* From June to August, we will build the setup and technical groundwork. 
* From September to November 2019, we will develop the first version of the feature and publish a test system so you can try it and give feedback. 
* Later on, we will test the feature on a few projects, in collaboration with the communities. 
** We will first focus on early adopters communities who already implemented a shortcut from their infoboxes to edit Wikidata (for example Russian, Catalan, Basque Wikipedias)
** but we also welcome also communities who [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge/Get_involved|volunteer to be part of the first test round]]. 
** Then we will reach some of the big Wikipedias (French, German, English) in order to see if the project scales and to address their potentially different needs. 
** Even later, we can consider enabling the feature on all the other projects. 
In any case, no deployment or big change will be enforced on the projects without talking to the communities first, and helping the template builders to prepare for the changes they will have to do on the infoboxes’ code.

If you want to get involved, there are several ways to help:
* Read and help translating [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge|the documentation pages]]
* Follow the [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge/Updates|updates]] and participate in [[mw:Topic:V1x2lxtu8rgi954a|the first feedback loop]]
* Talk about it with your local community
More ideas will be added [[mw:Wikidata_Bridge/Get_involved|on this page]] along the way

If you have any questions for the development team, feel free to ask them [[mw:Talk:Wikidata_Bridge|on the main talk page]]. You can also ask under this message, but if you expect an answer from me, please make sure to ping me.

== Google Code-In will soon take place again! Mentor tasks to help new contributors! ==

Hi everybody! Google Code-in (GCI) will soon take place again - a seven week long contest for 13-17 year old students to contribute to free software projects. Tasks should take an experienced contributor about two or three hours and can be of the categories Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance, and User Interface/Design. Do you have any Lua, template, gadget/script or similar task that would benefit your wiki? Or maybe some of your tools need better documentation? If so, and you can imagine enjoying mentoring such a task to help a new contributor, please check out [[:mw:Google Code-in/2019]] and become a mentor. If you have any questions, feel free to ask at [[:mw:Talk:Google Code-in/2019|our talk page]]. Many thanks in advance! --[[User:Martin Urbanec|Martin Urbanec]] 07:28, 5 Nofeembar 2019 (UTC)

The third edition of the [[m:Coolest Tool Award]] is looking for nominations!

Tools play an essential role for the Wikimedia projects, and so do the many volunteer developers who experiment with new ideas and develop and maintain local and global solutions to support the Wikimedia communities. The Coolest Tool Award aims to recognize and celebrate the coolest tools in a variety of categories.

The awarded projects will be announced and showcased in a virtual ceremony in December. Deadline to submit nominations is October 27. More information: [[m:Coolest Tool Award]]. Thanks for your recommendations! -- [[User:SSethi (WMF)|SSethi (WMF)]] for the  [[m:Coolest Tool Award#Coolest Tool Award 2021|2021 Coolest Tool Academy team]] 05:57, 19 Oktoobar 2021 (UTC)

== Community Wishlist Survey 2022 is coming. Help us! ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[m:Community Wishlist Survey 2022|Community Wishlist Survey 2022]] starts in less than two weeks ([https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20220110T1800 Monday 10 January 2022, 18:00 UTC]). We, the team organizing the Survey, need your help.

'''Only you can make the difference'''

How many people will hear and read about the Survey in their language? How many will decide to participate? Will there be enough of you to vote for a change you would like to see? It all depends on you, volunteers.

'''Why are we asking?'''

* [[m:Community Wishlist Survey/FAQ|We have improved the documentation]]. It's friendlier and easier to use. This will mean little if it's only in English.
* Thousands of volunteers haven't participated in the Survey yet. We'd like to improve that, too. Three years ago, 1387 people participated. Last year, there were 1773 of them. We hope that in the upcoming edition, there will be even more. You are better than us in contacting Wikimedians outside of wikis. We have prepared some images to share. More to come.

'''What is the Community Wishlist Survey?'''
[[File:Community Wishlist Survey banner - translatable.svg|350px|thumb]]
It's an annual survey that allows contributors to the Wikimedia projects to propose and vote for tools and platform improvements. Long years of experience in editing or technical skills are not required.

Thanks, and be safe and successful in 2022! [[User:SGrabarczuk (WMF)|SGrabarczuk (WMF)]] ([[User talk:SGrabarczuk (WMF)|talk]]) 03:15, 29 Diseembar 2021 (UTC)
