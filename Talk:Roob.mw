This page [[Roob]] ([[en:Rain]]) was containing information about the rain and was in progress. I don't understand why you delete it?
Who gave you the authority to delete pages in [[Soomaali|Somali Wikipedia]]? There are many pages that need to be deleted in [https://so.wikipedia.org Somali Wikipedia], but not ones that are under development. Please share with me your reasons and how we can prevent future accidents.
Thanks.
