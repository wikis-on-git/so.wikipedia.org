== Stewards confirmation rules ==

Hello, I made [[:m:Requests_for_comment/Confirmation_of_stewards|a proposal on Meta]] to change the rules for the steward confirmations. Currently consensus to remove is required for a steward to lose his status, however I think it's fairer to the community if every steward needed the consensus to keep. As this is an issue that affects all WMF wikis, I'm sending this notification to let people know & be able to participate. Best regards, --<small>[[User:MF-Warburg|MF-W]]</small> 16:12, 10 Abriil 2015 (UTC)

With [[:mw:Citoid|Citoid]] in VisualEditor, you click the 'book with bookmark' icon and paste in the URL for a reliable source:


[[File:Citoid in VisualEditor Screen Shot 2015-04-02.png|alt=Screenshot of Citoid's first dialog|centre|frameless|230x230px]]


Citoid looks up the source for you and returns the citation results.  Click the green "Insert" button to accept its results and add them to the article:  


[[File:Citoid results in VisualEditor Screen Shot 2015-04-02.png|alt=Screenshot of Citoid's initial results|centre|frameless|230x230px]]


After inserting the citation, you can change it.  Select the reference, and click the "Edit" button in the context menu to make changes.

[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>
Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's performance, the [[:mw:Citoid|Citoid]] reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. Status reports are posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on Mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

The weekly '''task triage meetings''' continue to be open to volunteers, each Wednesday at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150401T11&p1=224&am=30 11:00 (noon) PDT] (18:00 UTC).  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|Editing team's Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]]. 
=== Recent improvements ===
VisualEditor is now substantially faster.  In many cases, opening the page in VisualEditor is now faster than opening it in the wikitext editor. The new system has improved the code speed by 37% and [[:mw:RESTBase|network speed]] by almost 40%.

The Editing team is slowly adding '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. This is currently available only at the French, Italian, and English Wikipedias.  The '''[[:mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for [[:en:ISBN|ISBNs]], [[:en:PubMed#PubMed_identifier|PMIDs]], and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections by contributing to the Citoid service's definitions for each website.

Citoid requires good [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your citation templates.  If you would like to request this feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the TemplateData for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

The '''special character inserter''' has been improved, based upon feedback from active users.  After this, VisualEditor was made available to all users of Wikipedias on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5]] list on 30 March.  This affected 53 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans''', '''Azerbaijani''', '''Breton''', '''Kyrgyz''', '''Macedonian''', '''Mongolian''', '''Tatar''', and''' Welsh'''. 

Work continues to support languages with complex requirements, such as Korean and Japanese.  These languages use [[w:input method editor|input method editors]] ("IMEs”).  Recent improvements to cursoring, backspace, and delete behavior will simplify typing in VisualEditor for these users.

The design for the image selection process is now using a "masonry fit" model.  Images in the search results are displayed at the same height but at variable widths, similar to bricks of different sizes in a masonry wall, or the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Images#Mode parameter|"packed" mode in image galleries]].  This style helps you find the right image by making it easier to see more details in images.

You can now '''drag and drop categories''' to re-arrange their order of appearance ​on the page.

The pop-up window that appears when you click on a reference, image, link, or other element, is called the "context menu".  It now displays additional useful information, such as the destination of the link or the image's filename.  The team has also added an explicit "Edit" button in the context menu, which helps new editors open the tool to change the item.

'''Invisible templates are marked by a puzzle piece icon''' so they can be interacted with. Users also will be able to see and edit HTML anchors now in section headings.

Users of the TemplateData GUI editor can now set a string as an optional text for the 'deprecated' property in addition to boolean value, which lets you tell users of the template what they should do instead. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90734 T90734])

=== Looking ahead ===
The special character inserter in VisualEditor will soon use the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki will also have the option of creating a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Instructions for customizing the list will be posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].

The team is discussing a test of VisualEditor with new users at the English Wikipedia, to see whether they have met their goals of making VisualEditor suitable for those editors.  The timing is unknown, but might be relatively soon. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90666 T90666])

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wmf logo vert pms.svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.  One position is being filled.  More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC Ombudsperson elections/2015|the FDC Ombudsperson elections page]]. 

The candidacy submission phase lasts from 00:00 UTC April 20 to 23:59 UTC May 5 for the Board and from 00:00 UTCApril 20 to 23:59 UTC April 30 for the FDC and FDC Ombudsperson. This year, we are accepting both self-nominations and nominations of others. More information on this election and the nomination process can be found on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|the 2015 Wikimedia elections page on Meta-Wiki]].

Please feel free to post a note about the election on your project's village pump. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the talk page on Meta, or sent to the election committee's mailing list, board-elections -at- wikimedia.org
