== New way to edit wikitext ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

'''Summary''': There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|wikitext mode for the visual editor]]. Please [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|go try it out]].


We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it.

Consequently, we've planned a "wikitext mode" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the [[:mw:citoid|citoid service]] for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext.

All wikis now have access to this mode as a [[:mw:Beta Features|Beta Feature]]. When enabled, it replaces your existing [[:mw:Editor|wikitext editor]] everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an ''opt-in-only'' Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to "{{Int:Betafeatures-auto-enroll}}".

The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the [[:mw:Extension:WikiEditor|current wikitext editor]]). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and ''vice versa''), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Gadgets|work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work]] with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do.

This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor/Feedback|on the feedback page]].  You may write comments in any language.  Thank you.

== Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Updates/Initial announcements review|Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''

The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

== Read-only mode for 20 to 30 minutes on 19 April and 3 May ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]].

== Beta Feature Two Column Edit Conflict View ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
From May 9, the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Two_Column_Edit_Conflict_View|Two Column Edit Conflict View]] will be available as a [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Beta Features|beta feature]] on all wikis. The Two Column Edit Conflict View is a new interface for the edit conflict resolution page. It highlights differences between the editor's and the conflicting changes to make it easy to copy and paste pieces of the text and resolve the conflict. The feature fulfils a request for a more user-friendly edit conflict resolution from the [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|German Community’s Technical Wishlist]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature and we hope that it will serve you well! </div> [[m:user:Birgit Müller (WMDE)|Birgit Müller (WMDE)]] 14:41, 8 May 2017 (UTC)

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[:mediawikiwiki:2017_wikitext_editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]] which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding [[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|the new visual diff tool]]. Their workboard is available [[:phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at  [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].   Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[:mw:Beta Features|beta feature]], and improving the visual diff tool.   

=== Recent changes ===
*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] to enable the {{Int:Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label}}. 
* A new '''[[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See [[:mw:Editor|a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org]] if you are uncertain which one you use.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

[[File:Wikitext diff paragraph move correcting vandalism 2018.png|alt=Screenshot showing some changes, in the two-column wikitext diff display|center|frameless|250px]]

Sometimes, it is hard to see important changes in a wikitext diff.  This screenshot of a wikitext diff (click to enlarge) shows that the paragraphs have been rearranged, but it does not highlight the removal of a word or the addition of a new sentence.

If you [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the Beta Feature]] for "{{Int:visualeditor-preference-visualdiffpage-label}}", you will have a new option.  It will give you a new box at the top of every diff page.  This box will let you choose either diff system on any edit.

[[File:VisualEditor visual diff tool - toggle button.png|alt=Toggle button showing visual and wikitext options; visual option is selected|center|frameless|200px]]
Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.

In the visual diff, additions, removals, new links, and formatting changes will be highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2017/May|the last newsletter]], the [[mw:Editing|Editing Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]], which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and improving [[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|the visual diff tool]]. Their work board is available [[phab:project/view/3236/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at [[mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[mw:Editing team/Current priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor, and improving the visual diff tool.
===Recent changes===
*The '''[[mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]]''' is [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|available as a Beta Feature]] on desktop devices.  It has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  The team have been comparing the performance of different editing environments.  They have studied how long it takes to open the page and start typing.  The study uses data for more than one million edits during December and January.  Some changes have been made to improve the speed of the 2017 wikitext editor and the visual editor.  Recently, the 2017 wikitext editor opened fastest for most edits, and the 2010 WikiEditor was fastest for some edits.  More information will be posted at [[mw:Contributors/Projects/Editing performance]].
*The '''[[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' was developed for the visual editor.  It is now available to all users of the visual editor and the 2017 wikitext editor.  When you review your changes, you can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  You can also [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the new Beta Feature]] for "Visual diffs".  The Beta Feature lets you use the visual diff tool to view other people's edits on page histories and [[Special:RecentChanges]].  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T167508]
*[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|'''Wikitext syntax highlighting''']] is available as a Beta Feature for both [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor]] and the 2010 wikitext editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
*The [[mw:Citoid|citoid service]] automatically translates URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, and PubMed id numbers into wikitext citation templates.  It is very popular and useful to editors, although it can be a bit tricky to set up.  <mark>Your wiki can have this service.  Please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|read the instructions]]. You can [[phab:T127354|ask the team to help you enable citoid at your wiki]]</mark>.

===Let's work together===
*The team will talk about editing tools at an upcoming [[m:Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meetings|Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meeting]].
*Wikibooks, Wikiversity, and other communities may have the visual editor made available by default to contributors.  If your community wants this, then please contact [[mw:User talk:Deskana (WMF)|Dan Garry]].
*The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Contributors/Projects/Columns for references|automatically display long lists of references in columns]] on wide screens.

== New user group for editing sitewide CSS / JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all!

To improve the security of our readers and editors, permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which contain code that is executed in the browsers of users of the site.)
A new user group, <code dir="ltr">[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code>, has been created.
Starting four weeks from now, only members of this group will be able edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with <code dir="ltr">.css</code> or <code dir="ltr">.js</code> that is either in the <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:</code> namespace or is another user's user subpage).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the change [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|here]].

Please add users who need to edit CSS/JS to the new group (this can be done the same way new administrators are added, by stewards or local bureaucrats).
This is a dangerous permission; a malicious user or a hacker taking over the account of a careless interface-admin can abuse it in far worse ways than admin permissions could be abused. Please only assign it to users who need it, who are trusted by the community, and who follow common basic password and computer security practices (use strong passwords, do not reuse passwords, use two-factor authentication if possible, do not install software of questionable origin on your machine, use antivirus software if that's a standard thing in your environment).

Thanks!

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hi all,

as [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS/announcement 2|announced previously]], permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed: only members of the <code>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code> ({{int:group-interface-admin}}) group, and a few highly privileged global groups such as stewards, can edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with .css or .js that is either in the MediaWiki: namespace or is another user's user subpage). This is done to improve the security of readers and editors of Wikimedia projects. More information is available at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS]].

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 12 September 2018'''.
On '''Wednesday, 10 October 2018''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop when we switch.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Wednesday, 12 September and Wednesday, 10 October. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170503T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 13 September and Thursday 11 October). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

'''Change coming to how certain templates will appear on the mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
[[File:Page_issues_-_mobile_banner_example.jpg|thumb|Example of improvements]]

Hello,

In a few weeks the Readers web team will be changing how some templates look on the mobile web site. We will make these templates more noticeable when viewing the article. We ask for your help in updating any templates that don't look correct.

What kind of templates? Specifically templates that notify readers and contributors about issues with the content of an article – the text and information in the article. Examples like [[wikidata:Q5962027|Template:Unreferenced]] or [[Wikidata:Q5619503|Template:More citations needed]]. Right now these notifications are hidden behind a link under the title of an article. We will format templates like these (mostly those that use Template:Ambox or message box templates in general) to show a short summary under the page title. You can tap on the "Learn more" link to get more information.

For template editors we have [[mw:Recommendations_for_mobile_friendly_articles_on_Wikimedia_wikis#Making_page_issues_(ambox_templates)_mobile_friendly|some recommendations on how to make templates that are mobile-friendly]] and also further [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|documentation on our work so far]].

If you have questions about formatting templates for mobile, [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|please leave a note on the project talk page]] or [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Readers-Web-Backlog file a task in Phabricator] and we will help you.

== Machine translation support enabled today for Content Translation ==

{{int:Please-translate}}
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 

Hello, machine translation support for [[:mw:Content_translation|Content Translation]] (beta feature) has now been extended and enabled for users of this Wikipedia, with the inclusion of [[:en:Google_Translate|Google Translate]]. It can be used when translating Wikipedia articles with Content Translation. To start using this service, please choose ''Google Translate'' from the ''Automatic Translation'' dropdown menu that you see on the sidebar after you start translating an article. 

Please note, machine translation is available from all the languages that are supported by Google Translate, but Content Translation can still be used in the usual manner for translating from all languages, with or without machine translation support. While machine translation exists to aid creation of content conveniently, we would like to emphasise that before publishing, the final content should always be reviewed to avoid errors and ambiguity. We hope that your wiki community will find this new service useful, and that it will help you create more articles in your language.

Wikimedia Foundation and Google have collaborated to work out [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation/GT#Summary_of_our_agreement_with_Google|an agreement]] that allows the use of Google Translate without compromising Wikipedia’s policy of attribution of rights, privacy of our users and brand representation. For more information, we request you to kindly take a look at the details about [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation|machine translation services in Content Translation]] and about [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation/GT|Google Translate translation services]]. You can also read the [https://wikimediafoundation.org/2019/01/09/you-can-now-use-google-translate-to-translate-articles-on-wikipedia main announcement on Wikimedia news]. Please note, translations made using Content Translation are also used to improve machine translation services.

We have tested the service for use, but there could be unknown problems that we are not aware of yet. Please do let us know on our [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Project Talk page]] if you face any problems using Content Translation. This message is only in English and we will be very grateful if it could be translated into for other users of this Wikipedia. 

Thank you. -- On behalf of WMF Language team: [[m:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[m:User_talk:Runab_WMF|talk]]) 16:15, 9 Jannaayo 2019 (UTC)

[[File:Logo for the beta feature FileExporter.svg|thumb|Coming soon: the beta feature [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]]]
A new beta feature will soon be released on all wikis: The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]. It allows exports of files from a local wiki to Wikimedia Commons, including their file history and page history. Which files can be exported is defined by each wiki's community: '''Please check your wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration file documentation|configuration file]]''' if you want to use this feature.

The FileExporter has already been a beta feature on [https://www.mediawiki.org mediawiki.org], [https://meta.wikimedia.org meta.wikimedia], deWP, faWP, arWP, koWP and on [https://wikisource.org wikisource.org]. After some functionality was added, it's now becoming a beta feature on all wikis. Deployment is planned for January 16. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|on the project page]]. 

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test the FileExporter, please activate it in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]]. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help_talk:Extension:FileImporter|central talk page]]. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

[[File:OOjs_UI_icon_speechBubbles-rtl.svg|alt="￼icon depicting two speech Bubbles"|frameless|right|120px]]
The Wikimedia Foundation is planning a [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|global consultation about communication]]. The goal is to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to improve tools for communication.

We want all contributors to be able to talk to each other on the wikis, whatever their experience, their skills or their devices.

We are looking for input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible. It will come from multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives.

We are currently planning the consultation. We need your help.

'''We need volunteers to help talk to their communities or user groups.'''

You can help by hosting a discussion at your wiki. Here's what to do:  
# First, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Participant group sign-up|sign up your group here.]]  
# Next, create a page (or a section on a Village pump, or an e-mail thread – whatever is natural for your group) to collect information from other people in your group.  This is not a vote or decision-making discussion: we are just collecting feedback.  
# Then ask people what they think about communication processes.  We want to hear stories and other information about how people communicate with each other on and off wiki.  Please consider asking these five questions:
## When you want to discuss a topic with your community, what tools work for you, and what problems block you?
## What about talk pages works for newcomers, and what blocks them?
## What do others struggle with in your community about talk pages?
## What do you wish you could do on talk pages, but can't due to the technical limitations?
## What are the important aspects of a "wiki discussion"?
# Finally, please go to [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk pages consultation 2019 on Mediawiki.org]] and report what you learned from your group.  Please include links if the discussion is available to the public.

'''You can also help build the list of the many different ways people talk to each other.'''

Not all groups active on wikis or around wikis use the same way to discuss things: it can happen on wiki, on social networks, through external tools... Tell us [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use|how your group communicates]].

You can read more about [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the overall process]] on mediawiki.org. If you have questions or ideas, you can [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|leave feedback about the consultation process]] in the language you prefer.

Thank you! We're looking forward to talking with you.

Welcome back to the [[mw:Editing|Editing]] newsletter.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2018/October|the last newsletter]], the team has released two new features for the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|mobile visual editor]] and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to [[m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2018-2019/Audiences#Outcome 3: Mobile Contribution|make editing on mobile web simpler]].  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

<strong>Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?</strong>

If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

<em>Follow these instructions and share your experience:</em>

<strong>[[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 Try Edit Cards]].</strong>

=== Recent releases ===
The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the [[mw:Reading/Web/Mobile#About|mobile site]].  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 

# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing|Section editing]]
#* The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.
#* The team studied this with an A/B test.  [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing#16 June 2019|This test showed]] that contributors who could use section editing were '''1% more likely to publish''' the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.
# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#March 1, 2019|Loading overlay]]
#* The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.

Section editing and the new loading overlay are '''now available to everyone''' using the mobile visual editor.

=== New and active projects ===
This is a list of our most active projects. [[mw:Help:Watching pages|Watch]] these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.

*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|Edit cards]]: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  <em>Go here to see how:</em> [[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 <em>Try Edit Cards</em>]].
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Mobile toolbar refresh]]: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|Mobile visual editor availability]]: This A/B test asks:  ''Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?''  We are collaborating with [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default#26 June 2019 %E2%80%93 Participating wikis and test start date|20 Wikipedias]] to answer this question.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Usability improvements|Usability improvements]]: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.

=== Looking ahead ===

* '''Wikimania:'''  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending [[wmania:|Wikimania]] in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|Community Growth space]].  Talk to the team about how editing can be improved.
* '''Talk Pages:'''  In the coming months, the Editing Team will begin [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|improving talk pages]] and communication on the wikis.

=== Learning more ===
The [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|VisualEditor on mobile]] is a good place to learn more about the projects we are working on. The team wants to talk with you about anything related to editing. If you have something to say or ask, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

== New tools and IP masking ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hey everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling.

We have an idea of what tools ''could'' be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project [[m:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|on Meta]] and [[m:Talk:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|post comments and feedback]]. Now is when we need to hear from you to be able to give you better tools to handle vandalism, spam and harassment.

You can post in your language if you can't write in English.

== The consultation on partial and temporary Foundation bans just started ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello, 

In a [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|recent statement]], the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|requested that staff hold a consultation]] to "re-evaluat[e] or add community input to the two new office action policy tools (temporary and partial Foundation bans)".

Accordingly, the Foundation's Trust & Safety team invites all Wikimedians [[:m:Office actions/Community consultation on partial and temporary office actions/09 2019|to join this consultation and give their feedback]] from 30 September to 30 October. 

How can you help?

* Suggest how partial and temporary Foundation bans should be used, if they should (eg: On all projects, or only on a subset);

* Give ideas about how partial and temporary Foundation bans should ideally implemented, if they should be; and/or

* Propose changes to the existing Office Actions policy on partial and temporary bans.

We offer our thanks in advance for your contributions, and we hope to get as much input as possible from community members during this consultation!

== Feedback wanted on Desktop Improvements project ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{Int:Please-translate}}

{{int:Hello}}. The Readers Web team at the WMF will work on some [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|improvements to the desktop interface]] over the next couple of years. The goal is to increase usability without removing any functionality. We have been inspired by changes made by volunteers, but that currently only exist as local gadgets and user scripts, prototypes, and volunteer-led skins. We would like to begin the process of bringing some of these changes into the default experience on all Wikimedia projects. 

We are currently in the research stage of this project and are looking for ideas for improvements, as well as feedback on our current ideas and mockups.  So far, we have performed interviews with community members at Wikimania. We have gathered lists of previous volunteer and WMF work in this area. We are examining possible technical approaches for such changes.  

We would like individual feedback on the following:

* Identifying focus areas for the project we have not yet discovered
* Expanding the list of existing gadgets and user scripts that are related to providing a better desktop experience. If you can think of some of these from your wiki, please let us know
* Feedback on the ideas and mockups we have collected so far

We would also like to gather a list of wikis that would be interested in being test wikis for this project - these wikis would be the first to receive the updates once we’re ready to start building. 

When giving feedback, please consider the following goals of the project:

* Make it easier for readers to focus on the content
* Provide easier access to everyday actions (e.g. search, language switching, editing)
* Put things in logical and useful places
* Increase consistency in the interface with other platforms - mobile web and the apps
* Eliminate clutter
* Plan for future growth

As well as the following constraints:

* Not touching the content - no work will be done in terms of styling templates or to the structure of page contents themselves
* Not removing any functionality - things might move around, but all navigational items and other functionality currently available by default will remain
* No drastic changes to the layout - we're taking an evolutionary approach to the changes and want the site to continue feeling familiar to readers and editors

Please give all feedback (in any language) at [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements]] 

After this round of feedback, we plan on building a prototype of suggested changes based on the feedback we receive. You’ll hear from us again asking for feedback on this prototype.

As you might guess from the name, this feature gives you a preview of references in the article text. That means, you can look up a reference without jumping down to the bottom of the page.

Reference Previews have already been a beta feature on German and Arabic Wikipedia since April. Now they will become available on more wikis. Deployment is planned for October 24. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|on the project page]].

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test Reference Previews, please activate the beta feature in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]] and let us know what you think. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help talk:Reference Previews|central talk page]]. We hope the feature will serve you well in your work. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

== Editing News #2 – Mobile editing and talk pages ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<em>[[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2019/October|Read this in another language]] • [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]</em>

Inside this newsletter, the [[mw:Editing|Editing team]] talks about their work on the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]], on [[mw:Talk pages project|the new talk pages project]], and at [[wikimania:|Wikimania 2019]].

=== Help ===
<strong>What talk page interactions do you remember?</strong> Is it a story about how someone helped you to learn something new? Is it a story about how someone helped you get involved in a group? Something else?  Whatever your story is, we want to hear it!  

Please tell us a story about how you used a talk page.  <mark>Please share a link to a memorable discussion, or describe it on the <strong>[[mw:Topic:V8d91yh8gcg404dj|talk page for this project]]</strong>.</mark>  The team wants your examples.  These examples will help everyone develop a shared understanding of what this project should support and encourage.

=== Talk pages project ===
The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk Pages Consultation]] was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 2 report|Phase 2 Report]] of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: [[mw:Talk pages project|Talk Page Project project page]]. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>"Getting involved"</strong>]] section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

=== Mobile visual editor ===
The Editing team is trying to make it simpler to edit on mobile devices.  The team is changing the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|visual editor on mobile]]. If you have something to say about editing on a mobile device, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

=== Wikimania ===
The Editing Team attended [[wmania:2019:Program|Wikimania 2019]] in Sweden.  They led a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|the mobile visual editor]] and a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/After Flow: A new direction for improving talk pages|the new talk pages project]].  They tested [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh#v1 prototype|two]] new [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards#v3 prototype|features]] in the mobile visual editor with contributors.  You can read more about what the team did and learned in [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#Wikimania Stockholm: Overview|the team's report on Wikimania 2019]].

=== Looking ahead ===

== Additional interface for edit conflicts on talk pages ==

''Sorry, for writing this text in English. If you could help to translate it, it would be appreciated.'' 

You might know the new interface for edit conflicts (currently a beta feature). Now, Wikimedia Germany is designing an additional interface to solve edit conflicts on talk pages. This interface is shown to you when you write on a discussion page and another person writes a discussion post in the same line and saves it before you do. With this additional editing conflict interface you can adjust the order of the comments and edit your comment.  We are inviting everyone to have a look at [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Edit Conflicts#Edit conflicts on talk pages|the planned feature]].

[[File:WPWP logo 1.png|150px|right|Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP)]]
This is to invite you to join the Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP) campaign to help improve Wikipedia articles with photos and win prizes. The campaign starts today 1st July 2020 and closes 31st August 2020.

The campaign primarily aims at using images from Wikimedia Commons on Wikipedia articles that are lacking images. Participants will choose among Wikipedia pages without photo images, then add a suitable file from among the many thousands of photos in the Wikimedia Commons, especially those uploaded from thematic contests (Wiki Loves Africa, Wiki Loves Earth, Wiki Loves Folklore, etc.) over the years.

Please visit the '''[[m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos|campaign page]]''' to learn more about the WPWP Campaign.

With kind regards,

Thank you,

* More than <strong>50 million edits</strong> have been made using the visual editor on desktop.
* More than <strong>2 million new articles</strong> have been created in the visual editor. More than 600,000 of these new articles were created during 2019.
* The visual editor is <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.  The proportion of all edits made using the visual editor has increased every year since its introduction.
* In 2019, <strong>35% of the edits by newcomers</strong> (logged-in editors with ≤99 edits) used the visual editor. This percentage has <strong>increased every year</strong>.
* Almost <strong>5 million edits on the mobile site</strong> have been made with the visual editor.  Most of these edits have been made since the Editing team started improving the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]] in 2018.
* On 17 November 2019, the [https://discuss-space.wmflabs.org/t/first-edit-made-to-wikipedia-from-outer-space/2254 <strong>first edit from outer space</strong>] was made in the mobile visual editor. 🚀 👩‍🚀

== Announcing a new wiki project! Welcome, Abstract Wikipedia ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all,

It is my honor to introduce Abstract Wikipedia, a new project that has been unanimously approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. Abstract Wikipedia proposes a new way to generate baseline encyclopedic content in a multilingual fashion, allowing more contributors and more readers to share more knowledge in more languages. It is an approach that aims to make cross-lingual cooperation easier on our projects, increase the sustainability of our movement through expanding access to participation, improve the user experience for readers of all languages, and innovate in free knowledge by connecting some of the strengths of our movement to create something new.

This is our first new project in over seven years. Abstract Wikipedia was submitted as a project proposal by Denny Vrandečić in May 2020 <ref>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract Wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia]]</ref> after years of preparation and research, leading to a detailed plan and lively discussions in the Wikimedia communities. We know that the energy and the creativity of the community often runs up against language barriers, and information that is available in one language may not make it to other language Wikipedias. Abstract Wikipedia intends to look and feel like a Wikipedia, but build on the powerful, language-independent conceptual models of Wikidata, with the goal of letting volunteers create and maintain Wikipedia articles across our polyglot Wikimedia world.

The project will allow volunteers to assemble the fundamentals of an article using words and entities from Wikidata. Because Wikidata uses conceptual models that are meant to be universal across languages, it should be possible to use and extend these building blocks of knowledge to create models for articles that also have universal value. Using code, volunteers will be able to translate these abstract “articles” into their own languages. If successful, this could eventually allow everyone to read about any topic in Wikidata in their own language.

As you can imagine, this work will require a lot of software development, and a lot of cooperation among Wikimedians. In order to make this effort possible, Denny will join the Foundation as a staff member in July and lead this initiative. You may know Denny as the creator of Wikidata, a long-time community member, a former staff member at Wikimedia Deutschland, and a former Trustee at the Wikimedia Foundation <ref>[[m:User:Denny|User:Denny]]</ref>. We are very excited that Denny will bring his skills and expertise to work on this project alongside the Foundation’s product, technology, and community liaison teams.

It is important to acknowledge that this is an experimental project, and that every Wikipedia community has different needs. This project may offer some communities great advantages. Other communities may engage less. Every language Wikipedia community will be free to choose and moderate whether or how they would use content from this project.

We are excited that this new wiki-project has the possibility to advance knowledge equity through increased access to knowledge. It also invites us to consider and engage with critical questions about how and by whom knowledge is constructed. We look forward to working in cooperation with the communities to think through these important questions.

There is much to do as we begin designing a plan for Abstract Wikipedia in close collaboration with our communities. I encourage you to get involved by going to the project page and joining the new mailing list <ref>[[mail:abstract-wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia mailing list]]</ref>. We recognize that Abstract Wikipedia is ambitious, but we also recognize its potential. We invite you all to join us on a new, unexplored path.

Yours,

Katherine Maher (Executive Director, Wikimedia Foundation)

== The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC): we want to hear from you. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''{{int:Hello}}. Apologies that you may not be reading this message in your native language: translations of the following message may be available on [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Message to small and medium sized wikis|Meta]]. {{int:please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}''<br>

At times, our contributor communities and projects have suffered from a lack of guidelines that can help us create an environment where free knowledge can be shared safely without fear. 
There has been talk about the need for a global set of conduct rules in different communities over time. 

Recently, the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees announced a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard/May_2020_-_Board_of_Trustees_on_Healthy_Community_Culture,_Inclusivity,_and_Safe_Spaces|Community Culture Statement]], asking for new standards to address harassment and promote inclusivity across projects.

The universal code of conduct will be a binding minimum set of standards across all Wikimedia projects, and will apply to all of us, staff and volunteers alike, all around the globe. It is of great importance that we all participate in expressing our opinions and thoughts about UCoC and its values. We should think about what we want it to cover or include and what it shouldn’t include, and how it may create difficulties or help our groups. 

This is the time to talk about it. Before starting drafting the code of conduct, we would like to hear from you and to solicit the opinions and feedback of your colleagues. 
In order for your voice to be heard, we encourage and invite you to read more about [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct|the universal code of conduct (UCoC)]] and then write down your opinions or feedback [[:m:Talk:Universal_Code_of_Conduct|on the discussion page]].  

To reduce language barriers during the process, you are welcome to translate [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Universal+Code+of+Conduct&language=en&action=page&filter= the universal code of conduct main page] from English into your respective local language. You and your community may choose to provide your opinions/feedback using your local languages. 

Thanks in advance for your attention and contributions, [[:m:Talk:Trust_and_Safety|The Trust and Safety team at Wikimedia Foundation]] 16:42, 22 Luuliyo 2020 (UTC)

== Technical Wishes: FileExporter and FileImporter become default features on all Wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter and FileImporter]] will become a default features on all wikis until August 7, 2020. They are planned to help you to move files from your local wiki to Wikimedia Commons easier while keeping all original file information (Description, Source, Date, Author, View History) intact. Additionally, the move is documented in the files view history. 
How does it work? 

Step 1: If you are an auto-confirmed user, you will see a link "Move file to Wikimedia Commons" on the local file page. 

Step 2: When you click on this link, the FileImporter checks if the file can in fact be moved to Wikimedia Commons. These checks are performed based on the wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration_file_documentation|configuration file]] which is created and maintained by each local wiki community. 

Step 3: If the file is compatible with Wikimedia Commons, you will be taken to an import page, at which you can update or add information regarding the file, such as the description. You can also add the 'Now Commons' template to the file on the local wiki by clicking the corresponding check box in the import form. Admins can delete the file from the local wiki by enabling the corresponding checkbox. By clicking on the 'Import' button at the end of the page, the file is imported to Wikimedia Commons. 

If you want to know more about the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileImporter extension]] or the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes|Technical Wishes Project]], follow the links. --For the Technical Wishes Team: </div>[[User:Max Klemm (WMDE)|Max Klemm (WMDE)]] 09:14, 6 Agoosto 2020 (UTC)

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data centre on '''Tuesday, September 1st 2020'''.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, September 1st. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200901T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 19:30 IST, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Wednesday September 2).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of September 1st, 2020.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

{{int:Hello}}. Please help pick a name for the new Wikimedia wiki project. This project will be a wiki where the community can work together on a library of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract_Wikipedia/Wiki_of_functions_naming_contest#function|functions]]. The community can create new functions, read about them, discuss them, and share them. Some of these functions will be used to help create language-independent Wikipedia articles that can be displayed in any language, as part of the Abstract Wikipedia project. But functions will also be usable in many other situations.

There will be two rounds of voting, each followed by legal review of candidates, with voting beginning on 29 September and 27 October. Our goal is to have a final project name selected on 8 December.

== Improving the translation support for the Somali Wikipedia ==

''Sorry about not being able to write in Somali. I hope someone can translate this!''

[[:mw:Content translation|Content translation]] has been successful in supporting the translation process on many Wikipedia communities, and we want to help additional wikis with potential to grow using translation as part of [[:mw:Content translation/Boost|a new initiative]].

Content translation facilitates the creation of Wikipedia articles by translating content from other languages. It has been used already to create more than half a million articles. In addition, the tool provides [[:mw:Help:Content translation/Translating/Translation quality|mechanisms to encourage the creation of good quality content]], preventing the publication of lightly edited machine translations. In general, our analysis shows that the translations produced are [[:mw:Content_translation/Deletion_statistics_comparison|less likely to be deleted than the articles started from scratch]].

Somali Wikipedia editors have used Content translation to create [[Special:CXStats|almost two hundred articles]]. Given the size of the editing community, we think that there is potential to use translation to create more articles, expand existing ones, and attract new editors that learn how to make productive edits. Translation can help the community to reduce the language gap with other languages and grow the number of editors in a sustainable way. In order to achieve this goal, we want to collaborate with you to make Content translation more visible in the Somali Wikipedia and support new ways to translate.

As a first step, during the next weeks we plan to enable Content translation by default on the Somali Wikipedia. That will make it easy for users to discover the tool [[:mw:Help:Content_translation/Starting|through several entry points]]. However, users not interested in translation will still be able to disable it from their preferences.

Please feel free to share any comment in this conversation thread.

Thanks! --[[User:Aaharoni-WMF|Amir E. Aharoni (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Aaharoni-WMF|wadahadal]]) 20:30, 14 Oktoobar 2020 (UTC)

== Wikidata descriptions changes to be included more often in Recent Changes and Watchlist ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for sending this message in English. Translations are available on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Announcements/Announcement Wikidata descriptions in watchlist|this page]]. Feel free to translate it in more languages!''

As you may know, you can include changes coming from Wikidata in your Watchlist and Recent Changes ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist|in your preferences]]). Until now, this feature didn’t always include changes made on Wikidata descriptions due to the way Wikidata tracks the data used in a given article.

Starting on December 3rd, the Watchlist and Recent Changes will include changes on the descriptions of Wikidata Items that are used in the pages that you watch. This will only include descriptions in the language of your wiki to make sure that you’re only seeing changes that are relevant to your wiki.

This improvement was requested by many users from different projects. We hope that it can help you monitor the changes on Wikidata descriptions that affect your wiki and participate in the effort of improving the data quality on Wikidata for all Wikimedia wikis and beyond.

Note: if you didn’t use the Wikidata watchlist integration feature for a long time, feel free to give it another chance! The feature has been improved since the beginning and the content it displays is more precise and useful than at the beginning of the feature in 2015.

If you encounter any issue or want to provide feedback, feel free to use [[Phab:T191831|this Phabricator ticket]]. Thanks!

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].

== Line numbering coming soon to all wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

[[File:Technical_Wishes_–_Line_numbering_-_2010_wikitext_editor.png|thumb|Example]]
From April 15, you can enable line numbering in some wikitext editors - for now in the template namespace, coming to more namespaces soon. This will make it easier to detect line breaks and to refer to a particular line in discussions. These numbers will be shown if you enable the syntax highlighting feature ([[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|CodeMirror extension]]), which is supported in the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:WikiEditor|2010]] and [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/2017 wikitext editor|2017]] wikitext editors. 

More information can be found on [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|this project page]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|on this talk page]].

== Suggested Values ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

From April 29, it will be possible to suggest values for parameters in templates. Suggested values can be added to [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] and will then be shown as a drop-down list in [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor]]. This allows template users to quickly select an appropriate value. This way, it prevents potential errors and reduces the effort needed to fill the template with values. It will still be possible to fill in values other than the suggested ones.

More information, including the supported parameter types and how to create suggested values: [[mw:Help:TemplateData#suggestedvalues|[1]]] [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Suggested_values_for_template_parameters|[2]]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:Talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Suggested values for template parameters|on this talk page]].

[[File:Wikimania logo with text 2.svg|right|200px]]
Dear all,

Wikimania 2021 will be [[:wikimania:2021:Save the date and the Core Organizing Team|hosted virtually]] for the first time in the event's 15-year history. Since there is no in-person host, the event is being organized by a diverse group of Wikimedia volunteers that form the [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers|Core Organizing Team]] (COT) for Wikimania 2021.

'''Event Program''' - Individuals or a group of individuals can submit their session proposals to be a part of the program. There will be translation support for sessions provided in a number of languages. See more information [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines#Language Accessibility|here]].

Below are some links to guide you through;
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions|Program Submissions]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines|Session Submission Guidelines]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:FAQ|FAQ]]

Please note that the deadline for submission is 18th June 2021. 

'''Announcements'''- To keep up to date with the developments around Wikimania, the COT sends out weekly updates. You can view them in the Announcement section [[:wikimania:2021:Announcements|here]]. 

'''Office Hour''' - If you are left with questions, the COT will be hosting some office hours (in multiple languages), in multiple time-zones, to answer any programming questions that you might have.  Details can be found [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers#Office hours schedule|here.]]

[[File:Reply Tool A-B test comment completion.png|alt=Junior contributors comment completion rate across all participating Wikipedias|thumb|296x296px|When newcomers had the Reply tool and tried to post on a talk page, they were more successful at posting a comment. ([https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ Source])]]

Earlier this year, the Editing team ran a large study of [[mw:Talk pages project/Replying|the Reply Tool]].  The main goal was to find out whether the Reply Tool helped [[mw:Talk pages project/Glossary|newer editors]] communicate on wiki.  The second goal was to see whether the comments that newer editors made using the tool needed to be reverted more frequently than comments newer editors made with the existing wikitext page editor.

The key results were:

* Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ more likely] to post a comment on a talk page.
* The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ less likely] to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.

These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

<strong>Looking ahead</strong>

The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to [[phab:T280599|resolve a technical challenge]]. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the [[phab:T267379|Wikipedias that participated in the study]].  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "{{int:discussiontools-preference-label}}" [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|in Beta Features]] now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion]].

If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.

== Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election has come to an end ==

Thank you for participating in the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021|2021 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election]]! Voting closed August 31 at 23:59. The official data, including the four most voted candidates, will be announced as soon as the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections_committee|Elections Committee]] completes their review of the ballots. The official announcement of the new trustees appointed will happen later, once the selected candidates have been confirmed by the Board.

6,946 community members from 216 wiki projects have voted. This makes 10.2% global participation, 1.1% higher than in the last Board elections. In 2017, 5167 people from 202 wiki projects cast their vote. A full analysis is planned to be published in a few days when the confirmed results are announced. In the meantime, you can check the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021/Stats|data produced during the election]].

Diversity was an important goal with these elections. Messages about the Board election were translated into 61 languages. This outreach worked well. There were 70 communities with eligible voters voting in this election for the first time. With your help, next year’s Board of Trustees election will be even better.

== The 2022 Community Wishlist Survey will happen in January ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello everyone,

We hope all of you are as well and safe as possible during these trying times! We wanted to share some news about a change to the Community Wishlist Survey 2022. We would like to hear your opinions as well.

Summary:

<div style="font-style:italic;">
We will be running the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]] 2022 in January 2022. We need more time to work on the 2021 wishes. We also need time to prepare some changes to the Wishlist 2022. In the meantime, you can use a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|dedicated sandbox to leave early ideas for the 2022 wishes]].
</div>

=== Proposing and wish-fulfillment will happen during the same year ===

In the past, the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Tech|Community Tech]] team has run the Community Wishlist Survey for the following year in November of the prior year. For example, we ran the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey 2021|Wishlist for 2021]] in November 2020. That worked well a few years ago. At that time, we used to start working on the Wishlist soon after the results of the voting were published.

However, in 2021, there was a delay between the voting and the time when we could start working on the new wishes. Until July 2021, we were working on wishes from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey 2020|Wishlist for 2020]].

We hope having the Wishlist 2022 in January 2022 will be more intuitive. This will also give us time to fulfill more wishes from the 2021 Wishlist.

=== Encouraging wider participation from historically excluded communities ===

We are thinking how to make the Wishlist easier to participate in. We want to support more translations, and encourage under-resourced communities to be more active. We would like to have some time to make these changes.

=== A new space to talk to us about priorities and wishes not granted yet ===

We will have gone 365 days without a Wishlist. We encourage you to approach us. We hope to hear from you in the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Talk:Community Wishlist Survey|talk page]], but we also hope to see you at our bi-monthly Talk to Us meetings! These will be hosted at two different times friendly to time zones around the globe.

We will begin our first meeting '''September 15th at 23:00 UTC'''. More details about the agenda and format coming soon!

=== Brainstorm and draft proposals before the proposal phase ===

If you have early ideas for wishes, you can use the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|new Community Wishlist Survey sandbox]]. This way, you will not forget about these before January 2022. You will be able to come back and refine your ideas. Remember, edits in the sandbox don't count as wishes!

=== Feedback ===
* What should we do to improve the Wishlist pages?
* How would you like to use our new [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|sandbox?]]
* What, if any, risks do you foresee in our decision to change the date of the Wishlist 2022?
* What will help more people participate in the Wishlist 2022?

Answer on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Talk:Community Wishlist Survey|talk page]] (in any language you prefer) or at our Talk to Us meetings.

* Have knowledge of community consultations. 
* Have intercultural communication experience. 
* Have governance or organization experience in non-profits or communities. 
* Have experience negotiating with different parties. 

The Committee is expected to start with 15 people. If there are 20 or more candidates, a mixed election and selection process will happen. If there are 19 or fewer candidates, then the process of selection without election takes place.

Will you help move Wikimedia forward in this important role? Submit your candidacy [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement_Charter/Drafting_Committee#Candidate_Statements|here]].

*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message. We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it. If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal. Then you should be able to save your edit. But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
* We expect the code deployments to happen as any other week. However, some case-by-case code freezes could punctually happen if the operation require them afterwards.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch_Datacenter|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule. There will be more notifications about this. A banner will be displayed on all wikis 30 minutes before this operation happens.
