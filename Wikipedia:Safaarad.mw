== Wikipedia to the Moon: voting has begun ==

Hello, after six weeks of community discussion about [https://moon.wikimedia.org Wikipedia to the Moon], there are now 10 different proposals for content for the mission. Starting today, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Voting|you can vote for them on Meta-Wiki]], and decide what we will work on: a Wikipedia canon, different lists, the Moon in 300 languages, an astronomy editathon, featured articles, articles about technology, endangered things, or DNA-related topics. You can even vote against community involvement. Voting is open until 24 June. Sorry that this message is again in English only, but we are using village pumps to reach as many communities as possible, so that everyone knows they can vote. Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 15:31, 10 Juun 2016 (UTC)

== Compact Links coming soon to this wiki ==

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

Hello, I wanted to give a heads up about an upcoming feature for this wiki, which you may already seen in the latest issue of [[:m:Tech/News/2016/25|Tech News]]. [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). This will be enabled as a feature in the coming week for all users, which can be turned on or off using a preference setting. We look forward to  your feedback and please do let us know if you have any questions. Details about Compact Language Links can be read in the [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project documentation]].

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you. On behalf of the Wikimedia Language team: [[:mw:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[mw:User talk:Runab_WMF|talk]]) 14:01, 24 Juun 2016 (UTC)

== Compact Language Links enabled in this wiki today ==

{{int:Please-translate}}
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). Based on several factors, this shorter list of languages is expected to be more relevant for them and valuable for finding similar content in a language known to them. More information about compact language links can be found in [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|the documentation]].

From today onwards, compact language links has been enabled as the default listing of interlanguage links on this wiki. However, using the button at the bottom, you will be able to see a longer list of all the languages the article has been written in. The setting for this compact list can be changed by using the checkbox under ''User Preferences -> Appearance -> Languages''

The compact language links feature has been tested extensively by the Wikimedia Language team, which developed it. However, in case there are any problems or other feedback please let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project talk page]]. It is to be noted that on some wikis the presence of an existing older gadget that was used for a similar purpose may cause an interference for compact language list. We would like to bring this to the attention of the admins of this wiki. Full details are on [[phab:T131455|this phabricator ticket]] (in English).

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you.

== Wikipedia to the Moon: invitation to edit ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity. Please feel kindly invited to edit on behalf of your community and tell us about your work on featured content!

Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 14:10, 1 Luuliyo 2016 (UTC)

== Editing News #2—2016 ==

''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Newsletter/2016/June|Read this in another language]] • [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

<div style="float:right;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200px|center|alt=VisualEditor]]'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

It's quick and easy to insert a references list.
[[File:VisualEditor References List Insert Menu-en.png|alt=Screenshot showing a dropdown menu with many items|center|frameless|150px]]  

Place the cursor where you want to display the references list (usually at the bottom of the page).  Open the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu and click the "{{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}" icon (three books).

If you are using several groups of references, which is relatively rare, you will have the opportunity to specify the group. If you do that, then only the references that belong to the specified group will be displayed in this list of references.
Finally, click "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-action-insert}}" in the dialog to insert the {{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}.  This list will change as you add more footnotes to the page.

You can read and help translate [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

== Save/Publish ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[:mw:Editing|Editing]] team is planning to change the name of the [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] button to [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”]. “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” will be used when you create a new page. “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>” will be used when you change an existing page. The names will be consistent in all editing environments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131132][https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]

This change will probably happen during the week of 30 August 2016. The change will be announced in [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/News|Tech News]] when it happens.

If you are fluent in a language other than English, please check the status of translations at translatewiki.net for [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”].

The main reason for this change is to avoid confusion for new editors. Repeated user research studies with new editors have shown that some new editors believed that [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] would save a private copy of a new page in their accounts, rather than permanently publishing their changes on the web. It is important for this part of the user interface to be clear, since it is difficult to remove public information after it is published. We believe that the confusion caused by the “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>” button increases the workload for experienced editors, who have to clean up the information that people unintentionally disclose, and report it to the functionaries and stewards to suppress it. Clarifying what the button does will reduce this problem.

Beyond that, the goal is to make all the wikis and languages more consistent, and some wikis made this change many years ago. The [[:m:Legal|Legal team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation supports this change. Making the edit interface easier to understand will make it easier to handle licensing and privacy questions that may arise. 

Any help pages or other basic documentation about how to edit pages will also need to be updated, on-wiki and elsewhere. On wiki pages, you can use the wikitext codes <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishpage}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishchanges}}</nowiki></code> to display the new labels in the user's preferred language. For the language settings in [[Special:Preferences|your account preferences]], these wikitext codes produce “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” and “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>”.

Please share this news with community members who teach new editors and with others who may be interested.

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has mainly worked on a new wikitext editor.  They have also released some small features and the new map editing tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the list of work finished each week at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, releasing the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[mediawikiwiki:Beta_Features|beta feature]], and improving language support.
