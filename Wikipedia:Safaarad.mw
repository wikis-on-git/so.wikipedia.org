== Wikipedia to the Moon: voting has begun ==

Hello, after six weeks of community discussion about [https://moon.wikimedia.org Wikipedia to the Moon], there are now 10 different proposals for content for the mission. Starting today, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Voting|you can vote for them on Meta-Wiki]], and decide what we will work on: a Wikipedia canon, different lists, the Moon in 300 languages, an astronomy editathon, featured articles, articles about technology, endangered things, or DNA-related topics. You can even vote against community involvement. Voting is open until 24 June. Sorry that this message is again in English only, but we are using village pumps to reach as many communities as possible, so that everyone knows they can vote. Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 15:31, 10 Juun 2016 (UTC)

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

Hello, I wanted to give a heads up about an upcoming feature for this wiki, which you may already seen in the latest issue of [[:m:Tech/News/2016/25|Tech News]]. [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). This will be enabled as a feature in the coming week for all users, which can be turned on or off using a preference setting. We look forward to  your feedback and please do let us know if you have any questions. Details about Compact Language Links can be read in the [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project documentation]].

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you. On behalf of the Wikimedia Language team: [[:mw:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[mw:User talk:Runab_WMF|talk]]) 14:01, 24 Juun 2016 (UTC)
