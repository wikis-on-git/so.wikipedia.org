As many of you know, January 15 is Wikipedia’s 15th Birthday!

People around the world are getting involved in the celebration and have started adding their [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|events on Meta Page]]. While we are celebrating Wikipedia's birthday, we hope that all projects and affiliates will be able to utilize this celebration to raise awareness of our community's efforts.

Haven’t started planning? Don’t worry, there’s lots of ways to get involved. Here are some ideas:

* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|Join/host an event]]'''. We already have more than 80, and hope to have many more.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media|Talk to local press]]'''. In the past 15 years, Wikipedia has accomplished extraordinary things. We’ve made a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/15 years|handy summary]] of milestones and encourage you to add your own. More resources, including a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media#releases|press release template]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Communications/Movement Communications Skills|resources on working with the media]], are also available.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Material|Design a Wikipedia 15 logo]]'''. In place of a single icon for Wikipedia 15, we’re making dozens. Add your own with something fun and representative of your community. Just use the visual guide so they share a common sensibility.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events/Package#birthdaywish|Share a message on social media]]'''. Tell the world what Wikipedia means to you, and add #wikipedia15 to the post. We might re-tweet or share your message!

Everything is linked on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Wikipedia 15 Meta page]]. You’ll find a set of ten data visualization works that you can show at your events, and a [[c:Category:Wikipedia15 Mark|list of all the Wikipedia 15 logos]] that community members have already designed.

If you have any questions, please contact [[m:User:ZMcCune (WMF)|Zachary McCune]] or [[m:User:JSutherland (WMF)|Joe Sutherland]].

Thanks and Happy nearly Wikipedia 15!<br />
-The Wikimedia Foundation Communications team

== VisualEditor News #6—2015 ==

<div style="margin:0.5em;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}border:1px solid #AAA;padding:0.5em;">

A new, simpler system for editing will offer a single Edit button.  Once the page has opened, you can switch back and forth between visual and wikitext editing.      

[[File:VisualEditor single edit tab preference dialog.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up dialog for switching from the wikitext editor to the visual editor|centre|frameless|230x230px]]<br>

If you prefer having separate edit buttons, then you can set that option in your preferences, either in a pop-up dialog the next time you open the visual editor, or by going to [[Special:Preferences]] and choosing the setting that you want: <br><br>[[File:VisualEditor single edit tab in preferences 2015-12-18.png|alt=Screenshot showing a drop-down menu in Special:Preferences|centre|frameless|230x230px]]

The current plan is for the default setting to have the Edit button open the editing environment you used most recently. <br><br>You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.
</div></div>
''[[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2015/December|Read this in another language]]  •  [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|visual editor team]] has fixed many bugs and expanded the mathematics formula tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages such as Japanese and Arabic, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   

=== Recent improvements ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing.    
The '''LaTeX mathematics formula editor''' has been significantly expanded. ([[phab:T118616|T118616)]] You can see the formula as you change the LaTeX code.  You can click buttons to insert the correct LaTeX code for many symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''single edit tab''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, like the system already used on the mobile website.  ([[phab:T102398|T102398]], [[phab:T58337|T58337]])  Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.  Your last editing choice will be stored as a cookie for logged-out users and as an account preference for logged-in editors.  Logged-in editors will be able to set a default editor in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]] in the drop-down menu about "{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}".   

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the following Wikipedias in early 2016:  [[w:am:|Amharic]], [[w:bug:|Buginese]], [[w:cdo:|Min Dong]], [[w:cr:|Cree]], [[w:gv:|Manx]], [[w:hak:|Hakka]], [[w:hy:|Armenian]], [[w:ka:|Georgian]], [[w:pnt:|Pontic]], [[w:sh:|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:ti:|Tigrinya]], [[w:xmf:|Mingrelian]], [[w:za:|Zhuang]], and [[w:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]]. ([[phab:T116523|T116523]]) Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  

In 2016, the '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor on many Wikipedias will be redirected to mediawiki.org. ([[phab:T92661|T92661]])

=== Testing opportunities ===
* Please try the new system for the '''single edit tab''' on [https://test2.wikipedia.org test2.wikipedia.org].  You can edit while logged out to see how it works for logged-out editors, or you can create a separate account to be able to set your account's preferences.  <mark>Please share your thoughts about the single edit tab system at [[mediawikiwiki:Topic:Suspcq0bf5nd3gsd|the feedback topic on mediawiki.org]] or [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for formal user research]</mark> (type "single edit tab" in the question about other areas you're interested in).  The new system has not been finalized, and your feedback can affect the outcome.  The team particularly wants your thoughts about the options in Special:Preferences. The current choices in Special:Preferences are:
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}, 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}.  (This is the current state for people already using the visual editor.  None of these options will be visible if you have disabled the visual editor in your preferences at that wiki.)  
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|What to test]] if you can help, and report it on Phabricator ([[phab:T110654|Korean]] - [[phab:T109818|Japanese]]) or on Wikipedia ([[:ko:위키백과:시각편집기/IME|Korean]] - [[:ja:Wikipedia:ビジュアルエディター/フィードバック/IME|Japanese]]).

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[User:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[User talk:MediaWiki message delivery|talk]]) 19:06, 18 Jannaayo 2016 (UTC)

== Completion suggestor ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

To learn more about the work of the Discovery department and other improvements to search, please check out [[wmfblog:2015/12/23/search-and-discovery-on-wikipedia/|the Wikimedia blog]]. Read about  [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:CirrusSearch|CirrusSearch]], the MediaWiki extension that makes wiki search possible.</div> - [[User:CKoerner (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:CKoerner (WMF)|talk]]) 22:09, 7 Maarso 2016 (UTC)
