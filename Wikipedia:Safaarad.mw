== New way to edit wikitext ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

'''Summary''': There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|wikitext mode for the visual editor]]. Please [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|go try it out]].


We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it.

Consequently, we've planned a "wikitext mode" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the [[:mw:citoid|citoid service]] for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext.

All wikis now have access to this mode as a [[:mw:Beta Features|Beta Feature]]. When enabled, it replaces your existing [[:mw:Editor|wikitext editor]] everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an ''opt-in-only'' Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to "{{Int:Betafeatures-auto-enroll}}".

The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the [[:mw:Extension:WikiEditor|current wikitext editor]]). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and ''vice versa''), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Gadgets|work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work]] with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do.

This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor/Feedback|on the feedback page]].  You may write comments in any language.  Thank you.

== Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Updates/Initial announcements review|Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''

The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

== Read-only mode for 20 to 30 minutes on 19 April and 3 May ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]].

== Beta Feature Two Column Edit Conflict View ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
From May 9, the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Two_Column_Edit_Conflict_View|Two Column Edit Conflict View]] will be available as a [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Beta Features|beta feature]] on all wikis. The Two Column Edit Conflict View is a new interface for the edit conflict resolution page. It highlights differences between the editor's and the conflicting changes to make it easy to copy and paste pieces of the text and resolve the conflict. The feature fulfils a request for a more user-friendly edit conflict resolution from the [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|German Community’s Technical Wishlist]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature and we hope that it will serve you well! </div> [[m:user:Birgit Müller (WMDE)|Birgit Müller (WMDE)]] 14:41, 8 May 2017 (UTC)

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[:mediawikiwiki:2017_wikitext_editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]] which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding [[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|the new visual diff tool]]. Their workboard is available [[:phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at  [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].   Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[:mw:Beta Features|beta feature]], and improving the visual diff tool.   

=== Recent changes ===
*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] to enable the {{Int:Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label}}. 
* A new '''[[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See [[:mw:Editor|a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org]] if you are uncertain which one you use.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

[[File:Wikitext diff paragraph move correcting vandalism 2018.png|alt=Screenshot showing some changes, in the two-column wikitext diff display|center|frameless|250px]]

Sometimes, it is hard to see important changes in a wikitext diff.  This screenshot of a wikitext diff (click to enlarge) shows that the paragraphs have been rearranged, but it does not highlight the removal of a word or the addition of a new sentence.

If you [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the Beta Feature]] for "{{Int:visualeditor-preference-visualdiffpage-label}}", you will have a new option.  It will give you a new box at the top of every diff page.  This box will let you choose either diff system on any edit.

[[File:VisualEditor visual diff tool - toggle button.png|alt=Toggle button showing visual and wikitext options; visual option is selected|center|frameless|200px]]
Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.

In the visual diff, additions, removals, new links, and formatting changes will be highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2017/May|the last newsletter]], the [[mw:Editing|Editing Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]], which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and improving [[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|the visual diff tool]]. Their work board is available [[phab:project/view/3236/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at [[mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[mw:Editing team/Current priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor, and improving the visual diff tool.
===Recent changes===
*The '''[[mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]]''' is [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|available as a Beta Feature]] on desktop devices.  It has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  The team have been comparing the performance of different editing environments.  They have studied how long it takes to open the page and start typing.  The study uses data for more than one million edits during December and January.  Some changes have been made to improve the speed of the 2017 wikitext editor and the visual editor.  Recently, the 2017 wikitext editor opened fastest for most edits, and the 2010 WikiEditor was fastest for some edits.  More information will be posted at [[mw:Contributors/Projects/Editing performance]].
*The '''[[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' was developed for the visual editor.  It is now available to all users of the visual editor and the 2017 wikitext editor.  When you review your changes, you can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  You can also [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the new Beta Feature]] for "Visual diffs".  The Beta Feature lets you use the visual diff tool to view other people's edits on page histories and [[Special:RecentChanges]].  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T167508]
*[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|'''Wikitext syntax highlighting''']] is available as a Beta Feature for both [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor]] and the 2010 wikitext editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
*The [[mw:Citoid|citoid service]] automatically translates URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, and PubMed id numbers into wikitext citation templates.  It is very popular and useful to editors, although it can be a bit tricky to set up.  <mark>Your wiki can have this service.  Please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|read the instructions]]. You can [[phab:T127354|ask the team to help you enable citoid at your wiki]]</mark>.

===Let's work together===
*The team will talk about editing tools at an upcoming [[m:Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meetings|Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meeting]].
*Wikibooks, Wikiversity, and other communities may have the visual editor made available by default to contributors.  If your community wants this, then please contact [[mw:User talk:Deskana (WMF)|Dan Garry]].
*The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Contributors/Projects/Columns for references|automatically display long lists of references in columns]] on wide screens.

== New user group for editing sitewide CSS / JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all!

To improve the security of our readers and editors, permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which contain code that is executed in the browsers of users of the site.)
A new user group, <code dir="ltr">[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code>, has been created.
Starting four weeks from now, only members of this group will be able edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with <code dir="ltr">.css</code> or <code dir="ltr">.js</code> that is either in the <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:</code> namespace or is another user's user subpage).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the change [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|here]].

Please add users who need to edit CSS/JS to the new group (this can be done the same way new administrators are added, by stewards or local bureaucrats).
This is a dangerous permission; a malicious user or a hacker taking over the account of a careless interface-admin can abuse it in far worse ways than admin permissions could be abused. Please only assign it to users who need it, who are trusted by the community, and who follow common basic password and computer security practices (use strong passwords, do not reuse passwords, use two-factor authentication if possible, do not install software of questionable origin on your machine, use antivirus software if that's a standard thing in your environment).

Thanks!

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hi all,

as [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS/announcement 2|announced previously]], permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed: only members of the <code>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code> ({{int:group-interface-admin}}) group, and a few highly privileged global groups such as stewards, can edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with .css or .js that is either in the MediaWiki: namespace or is another user's user subpage). This is done to improve the security of readers and editors of Wikimedia projects. More information is available at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS]].

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 12 September 2018'''.
On '''Wednesday, 10 October 2018''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop when we switch.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Wednesday, 12 September and Wednesday, 10 October. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170503T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 13 September and Thursday 11 October). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

'''Change coming to how certain templates will appear on the mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
[[File:Page_issues_-_mobile_banner_example.jpg|thumb|Example of improvements]]

Hello,

In a few weeks the Readers web team will be changing how some templates look on the mobile web site. We will make these templates more noticeable when viewing the article. We ask for your help in updating any templates that don't look correct.

What kind of templates? Specifically templates that notify readers and contributors about issues with the content of an article – the text and information in the article. Examples like [[wikidata:Q5962027|Template:Unreferenced]] or [[Wikidata:Q5619503|Template:More citations needed]]. Right now these notifications are hidden behind a link under the title of an article. We will format templates like these (mostly those that use Template:Ambox or message box templates in general) to show a short summary under the page title. You can tap on the "Learn more" link to get more information.

For template editors we have [[mw:Recommendations_for_mobile_friendly_articles_on_Wikimedia_wikis#Making_page_issues_(ambox_templates)_mobile_friendly|some recommendations on how to make templates that are mobile-friendly]] and also further [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|documentation on our work so far]].

If you have questions about formatting templates for mobile, [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|please leave a note on the project talk page]] or [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Readers-Web-Backlog file a task in Phabricator] and we will help you.

== Machine translation support enabled today for Content Translation ==

{{int:Please-translate}}
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 

Hello, machine translation support for [[:mw:Content_translation|Content Translation]] (beta feature) has now been extended and enabled for users of this Wikipedia, with the inclusion of [[:en:Google_Translate|Google Translate]]. It can be used when translating Wikipedia articles with Content Translation. To start using this service, please choose ''Google Translate'' from the ''Automatic Translation'' dropdown menu that you see on the sidebar after you start translating an article. 

Please note, machine translation is available from all the languages that are supported by Google Translate, but Content Translation can still be used in the usual manner for translating from all languages, with or without machine translation support. While machine translation exists to aid creation of content conveniently, we would like to emphasise that before publishing, the final content should always be reviewed to avoid errors and ambiguity. We hope that your wiki community will find this new service useful, and that it will help you create more articles in your language.

Wikimedia Foundation and Google have collaborated to work out [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation/GT#Summary_of_our_agreement_with_Google|an agreement]] that allows the use of Google Translate without compromising Wikipedia’s policy of attribution of rights, privacy of our users and brand representation. For more information, we request you to kindly take a look at the details about [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation|machine translation services in Content Translation]] and about [[:mw:Content_translation/Machine_Translation/GT|Google Translate translation services]]. You can also read the [https://wikimediafoundation.org/2019/01/09/you-can-now-use-google-translate-to-translate-articles-on-wikipedia main announcement on Wikimedia news]. Please note, translations made using Content Translation are also used to improve machine translation services.

We have tested the service for use, but there could be unknown problems that we are not aware of yet. Please do let us know on our [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Project Talk page]] if you face any problems using Content Translation. This message is only in English and we will be very grateful if it could be translated into for other users of this Wikipedia. 

Thank you. -- On behalf of WMF Language team: [[m:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[m:User_talk:Runab_WMF|talk]]) 16:15, 9 Jannaayo 2019 (UTC)

[[File:Logo for the beta feature FileExporter.svg|thumb|Coming soon: the beta feature [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]]]
A new beta feature will soon be released on all wikis: The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]. It allows exports of files from a local wiki to Wikimedia Commons, including their file history and page history. Which files can be exported is defined by each wiki's community: '''Please check your wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration file documentation|configuration file]]''' if you want to use this feature.

The FileExporter has already been a beta feature on [https://www.mediawiki.org mediawiki.org], [https://meta.wikimedia.org meta.wikimedia], deWP, faWP, arWP, koWP and on [https://wikisource.org wikisource.org]. After some functionality was added, it's now becoming a beta feature on all wikis. Deployment is planned for January 16. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|on the project page]]. 

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test the FileExporter, please activate it in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]]. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help_talk:Extension:FileImporter|central talk page]]. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

[[File:OOjs_UI_icon_speechBubbles-rtl.svg|alt="￼icon depicting two speech Bubbles"|frameless|right|120px]]
The Wikimedia Foundation is planning a [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|global consultation about communication]]. The goal is to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to improve tools for communication.

We want all contributors to be able to talk to each other on the wikis, whatever their experience, their skills or their devices.

We are looking for input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible. It will come from multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives.

We are currently planning the consultation. We need your help.

'''We need volunteers to help talk to their communities or user groups.'''

You can help by hosting a discussion at your wiki. Here's what to do:  
# First, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Participant group sign-up|sign up your group here.]]  
# Next, create a page (or a section on a Village pump, or an e-mail thread – whatever is natural for your group) to collect information from other people in your group.  This is not a vote or decision-making discussion: we are just collecting feedback.  
# Then ask people what they think about communication processes.  We want to hear stories and other information about how people communicate with each other on and off wiki.  Please consider asking these five questions:
## When you want to discuss a topic with your community, what tools work for you, and what problems block you?
## What about talk pages works for newcomers, and what blocks them?
## What do others struggle with in your community about talk pages?
## What do you wish you could do on talk pages, but can't due to the technical limitations?
## What are the important aspects of a "wiki discussion"?
# Finally, please go to [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk pages consultation 2019 on Mediawiki.org]] and report what you learned from your group.  Please include links if the discussion is available to the public.

'''You can also help build the list of the many different ways people talk to each other.'''

Not all groups active on wikis or around wikis use the same way to discuss things: it can happen on wiki, on social networks, through external tools... Tell us [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use|how your group communicates]].

You can read more about [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the overall process]] on mediawiki.org. If you have questions or ideas, you can [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|leave feedback about the consultation process]] in the language you prefer.

Thank you! We're looking forward to talking with you.

Welcome back to the [[mw:Editing|Editing]] newsletter.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2018/October|the last newsletter]], the team has released two new features for the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|mobile visual editor]] and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to [[m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2018-2019/Audiences#Outcome 3: Mobile Contribution|make editing on mobile web simpler]].  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

<strong>Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?</strong>

If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

<em>Follow these instructions and share your experience:</em>

<strong>[[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 Try Edit Cards]].</strong>

=== Recent releases ===
The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the [[mw:Reading/Web/Mobile#About|mobile site]].  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 

# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing|Section editing]]
#* The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.
#* The team studied this with an A/B test.  [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing#16 June 2019|This test showed]] that contributors who could use section editing were '''1% more likely to publish''' the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.
# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#March 1, 2019|Loading overlay]]
#* The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.

Section editing and the new loading overlay are '''now available to everyone''' using the mobile visual editor.

=== New and active projects ===
This is a list of our most active projects. [[mw:Help:Watching pages|Watch]] these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.

*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|Edit cards]]: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  <em>Go here to see how:</em> [[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 <em>Try Edit Cards</em>]].
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Mobile toolbar refresh]]: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|Mobile visual editor availability]]: This A/B test asks:  ''Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?''  We are collaborating with [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default#26 June 2019 %E2%80%93 Participating wikis and test start date|20 Wikipedias]] to answer this question.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Usability improvements|Usability improvements]]: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.

=== Looking ahead ===

* '''Wikimania:'''  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending [[wmania:|Wikimania]] in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|Community Growth space]].  Talk to the team about how editing can be improved.
* '''Talk Pages:'''  In the coming months, the Editing Team will begin [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|improving talk pages]] and communication on the wikis.

=== Learning more ===
The [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|VisualEditor on mobile]] is a good place to learn more about the projects we are working on. The team wants to talk with you about anything related to editing. If you have something to say or ask, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

== New tools and IP masking ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hey everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling.

We have an idea of what tools ''could'' be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project [[m:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|on Meta]] and [[m:Talk:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|post comments and feedback]]. Now is when we need to hear from you to be able to give you better tools to handle vandalism, spam and harassment.

You can post in your language if you can't write in English.

== The consultation on partial and temporary Foundation bans just started ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello, 

In a [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|recent statement]], the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|requested that staff hold a consultation]] to "re-evaluat[e] or add community input to the two new office action policy tools (temporary and partial Foundation bans)".

Accordingly, the Foundation's Trust & Safety team invites all Wikimedians [[:m:Office actions/Community consultation on partial and temporary office actions/09 2019|to join this consultation and give their feedback]] from 30 September to 30 October. 

How can you help?

* Suggest how partial and temporary Foundation bans should be used, if they should (eg: On all projects, or only on a subset);

* Give ideas about how partial and temporary Foundation bans should ideally implemented, if they should be; and/or

* Propose changes to the existing Office Actions policy on partial and temporary bans.

We offer our thanks in advance for your contributions, and we hope to get as much input as possible from community members during this consultation!

== Feedback wanted on Desktop Improvements project ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{Int:Please-translate}}

{{int:Hello}}. The Readers Web team at the WMF will work on some [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|improvements to the desktop interface]] over the next couple of years. The goal is to increase usability without removing any functionality. We have been inspired by changes made by volunteers, but that currently only exist as local gadgets and user scripts, prototypes, and volunteer-led skins. We would like to begin the process of bringing some of these changes into the default experience on all Wikimedia projects. 

We are currently in the research stage of this project and are looking for ideas for improvements, as well as feedback on our current ideas and mockups.  So far, we have performed interviews with community members at Wikimania. We have gathered lists of previous volunteer and WMF work in this area. We are examining possible technical approaches for such changes.  

We would like individual feedback on the following:

* Identifying focus areas for the project we have not yet discovered
* Expanding the list of existing gadgets and user scripts that are related to providing a better desktop experience. If you can think of some of these from your wiki, please let us know
* Feedback on the ideas and mockups we have collected so far

We would also like to gather a list of wikis that would be interested in being test wikis for this project - these wikis would be the first to receive the updates once we’re ready to start building. 

When giving feedback, please consider the following goals of the project:

* Make it easier for readers to focus on the content
* Provide easier access to everyday actions (e.g. search, language switching, editing)
* Put things in logical and useful places
* Increase consistency in the interface with other platforms - mobile web and the apps
* Eliminate clutter
* Plan for future growth

As well as the following constraints:

* Not touching the content - no work will be done in terms of styling templates or to the structure of page contents themselves
* Not removing any functionality - things might move around, but all navigational items and other functionality currently available by default will remain
* No drastic changes to the layout - we're taking an evolutionary approach to the changes and want the site to continue feeling familiar to readers and editors

Please give all feedback (in any language) at [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements]] 

After this round of feedback, we plan on building a prototype of suggested changes based on the feedback we receive. You’ll hear from us again asking for feedback on this prototype.

As you might guess from the name, this feature gives you a preview of references in the article text. That means, you can look up a reference without jumping down to the bottom of the page.

Reference Previews have already been a beta feature on German and Arabic Wikipedia since April. Now they will become available on more wikis. Deployment is planned for October 24. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|on the project page]].

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test Reference Previews, please activate the beta feature in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]] and let us know what you think. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help talk:Reference Previews|central talk page]]. We hope the feature will serve you well in your work. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

== Editing News #2 – Mobile editing and talk pages ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<em>[[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2019/October|Read this in another language]] • [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]</em>

Inside this newsletter, the [[mw:Editing|Editing team]] talks about their work on the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]], on [[mw:Talk pages project|the new talk pages project]], and at [[wikimania:|Wikimania 2019]].

=== Help ===
<strong>What talk page interactions do you remember?</strong> Is it a story about how someone helped you to learn something new? Is it a story about how someone helped you get involved in a group? Something else?  Whatever your story is, we want to hear it!  

Please tell us a story about how you used a talk page.  <mark>Please share a link to a memorable discussion, or describe it on the <strong>[[mw:Topic:V8d91yh8gcg404dj|talk page for this project]]</strong>.</mark>  The team wants your examples.  These examples will help everyone develop a shared understanding of what this project should support and encourage.

=== Talk pages project ===
The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk Pages Consultation]] was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 2 report|Phase 2 Report]] of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: [[mw:Talk pages project|Talk Page Project project page]]. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>"Getting involved"</strong>]] section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

=== Mobile visual editor ===
The Editing team is trying to make it simpler to edit on mobile devices.  The team is changing the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|visual editor on mobile]]. If you have something to say about editing on a mobile device, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

=== Wikimania ===
The Editing Team attended [[wmania:2019:Program|Wikimania 2019]] in Sweden.  They led a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|the mobile visual editor]] and a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/After Flow: A new direction for improving talk pages|the new talk pages project]].  They tested [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh#v1 prototype|two]] new [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards#v3 prototype|features]] in the mobile visual editor with contributors.  You can read more about what the team did and learned in [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#Wikimania Stockholm: Overview|the team's report on Wikimania 2019]].

=== Looking ahead ===

* <strong>Talk Pages Project:</strong> The team is thinking about the first set of proposed changes.  The team will be working with a few communities to pilot those changes.

== Movement Learning and Leadership Development Project ==

Hello

The Wikimedia Foundation’s Community Development team is seeking to learn more about the way volunteers learn and develop into the many different roles that exist in the movement. Our goal is to build a movement informed framework that provides shared clarity and outlines accessible pathways on how to grow and develop skills within the movement. To this end, we are looking to speak with you, our community to learn about your journey as a Wikimedia volunteer. Whether you joined yesterday or have been here from the very start, we want to hear about the many ways volunteers join and contribute to our movement.
