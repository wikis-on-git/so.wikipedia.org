== Wikipedia to the Moon: voting has begun ==

Hello, after six weeks of community discussion about [https://moon.wikimedia.org Wikipedia to the Moon], there are now 10 different proposals for content for the mission. Starting today, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Voting|you can vote for them on Meta-Wiki]], and decide what we will work on: a Wikipedia canon, different lists, the Moon in 300 languages, an astronomy editathon, featured articles, articles about technology, endangered things, or DNA-related topics. You can even vote against community involvement. Voting is open until 24 June. Sorry that this message is again in English only, but we are using village pumps to reach as many communities as possible, so that everyone knows they can vote. Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 15:31, 10 Juun 2016 (UTC)
