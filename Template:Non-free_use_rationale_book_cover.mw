  | The entire front cover. Because the image is a {{SAFESUBST:<noinclude />#if:{{{Type|}}}|{{{Type|}}}|book}} cover, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.

  | The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original {{SAFESUBST:<noinclude />#if:{{{Type|}}}|{{{Type|}}}|book}} cover.

  | Author   = The image is used in a discussion of the author of the work, for purposes of commentary on the author and how it relates to this work. The discussion of the author would not be complete without referring to this work.
