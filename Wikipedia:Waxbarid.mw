[[File:Edit Button.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:42|A short video about that "Edit" button and what it can do when '''you are bold!''']]
As a new contributor, you may feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer size and scope of [[Wikipedia:About|this project called Wikipedia]]. Don't worry too much if you don't understand everything at first, as it is acceptable to [[WP:COMMONSENSE|use common sense]] as you go about editing. Wikipedia not only allows you to create, revise, and edit articles, but it wants you to do it...'''[[WP:Bold|be bold]]!''' You just need to remember that you can't break Wikipedia and although there are many protocols, [[WP:PERFECTION|perfection is not required]], as [[WP:WIP|Wikipedia is a work in progress]]. Collaborative editing means that incomplete or poorly written first drafts can [[Wikipedia:Article development|evolve over time into excellent articles]].

The goal of a Wikipedia article is to create a comprehensive and [[WP:NPOV|neutrally written]] summary of existing mainstream knowledge about a topic. Accordingly, Wikipedia does not publish [[WP:NOR|original research]]. An encyclopedia is, by its nature, a [[tertiary source]] that provides a survey of information already the subject of publication in the wider world. Accordingly, and because Wikipedia is open to editing by anyone, we require that information be [[WP:Verify|verifiable]] in [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable sources]]. Ideally all information should be actually ''[[WP:REFB|cited]]'' to reliable sources to evidence it is verifiable. When adding content and creating new articles an [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedic style|encyclopedic style]] with a [[WP:TONE|formal tone]] is important.  Instead of essay-like, argumentative, or opinionated writing, Wikipedia articles should have a straightforward, [[Wikipedia:Summary style|just-the-facts style]].

Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy|does not employ hard-and-fast rules]], however  [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]], [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Contents|formatting norms]] are developed by the community to describe the best practices, to clarify principles, resolve conflicts, and otherwise further our goals. General [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|social norms]] should be followed by all editors. The [[Wikipedia community]] is made up of people from different countries and cultures, with different views, perspectives, opinions, and backgrounds, sometimes varying widely.  Editors should treat each other  [[WP:Civility| respectfully]],  [[WP:AGF|work together collegiately]], and avoid behaviour that would be widely seen as [[Wikipedia:Here to build an encyclopedia|unacceptable]], [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive]], [[Wikipedia:Tendentious editing|tendentious]], or [[Wikipedia:Gaming the system|dishonest]].
