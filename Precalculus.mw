It is also called Introduction to Analysis. In many schools, precalculus is actually two separate courses: [[Algebra]] and [[Trigonometry]]. Precalculus prepares students for [[calculus]] the same way as [[pre-algebra]] prepares students for Algebra I. While pre-algebra teaches students many different fundamental algebra topics, precalculus does not involve calculus, but explores topics that will be applied in [[calculus]]. Some precalculus courses might differ with others in terms of content. For example, an honors level course might spend more time on topics such as [[conic sections]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, and other topics needed for calculus. A lower level class might focus on topics used in a wider selection of higher mathematical areas, such as matrices, which are used in business.
