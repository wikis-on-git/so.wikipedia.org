Oden days of Somali Cultuer

In the olden days of Somali culture were farming and pastoralists though they still have the culture but little bite some changes had occurred in them, they use to rare and farm as the main source of income. They have adopted to sell out the skin and the milk from the Animals as an exchange of their needs, for their dressing men use to wear sheet from down to top and turban as a dress and women use to wear a dress like a sheet as they do rolling themselves and as under they were wearing like the skirt and the head they were having headscarf to hide their body.

Waayihii hore ee Dhaqanka Somaaliyeed

Waagii hore ee dhaqanka Soomaalida waxa ay ahaayeen dad beeraley iyo xoolo dhaqato ah in kasta oo ay weli dhaqankii leeyihiin balse xoogaa is beddel ah ayaa ku dhacay, waxa ay ahaan jireen kuwo dhif iyo naadir ah oo beeraleydu tahay isha ugu weyn ee dhaqaalaha. Waxa ay qaateen in ay haragga iyo caanaha Xoolaha ka iibiyaan si ay ugu beddelaan baahidooda, waayo ragga dharkooda xidhan waxa ay xidhaan go’ hoos ilaa sare iyo cimaamad oo kale, dumarkuna sida go’ oo kale ayay u xidhaan. is rogroga oo sida hoostooda ayaa gashan sida goonnada iyo madaxa oo ay siteen xijaab si ay jidhkooda u qariyaan.
