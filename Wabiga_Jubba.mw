'''Waa in loo tarjumaa afka soomaaliga!'''

The '''Juba''' or '''Jubba River''' ([[Somali language|Somali]]: ''Jubba''}}) is a [[river]] in southern [[Somalia]].  It begins at the border with [[Ethiopia]] where the [[Dawa River|Dawa]] and [[Gebele River|Gebele]] rivers meet, and flows directly south to the [[Indian Ocean]].

The Juba basin region is primarily [[savanna]], and is the richest part of the country due to its fertility. The area receives the most rain in Somalia, and years in which this river has flooded include [[1960]] (causing a great loss of life), [[1997]], and May [[2005]]. Native wild life includes giraffes, cheetahs, lions, leopards, hyenas, buffalos, hippos, crocodiles, snakes, elephants, oryx, gazelles and wild asses.

The river gives its name to the Somali administrative regions of [[Middle Juba]] and [[Lower Juba]] as well as to the larger historical region of [[Jubaland]].
