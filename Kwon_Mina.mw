== Personal life ==

=== Bullying allegations against Jimin ===
On July 3, 2020, Kwon alleged in an [[Instagram]] post that AOA member [[Shin Ji-min]] had bullied her for a decade, which led to her withdrawal from the group in 2019. She posted a photo of her scarred wrist and claimed to have attempted suicide as a result of the bullying.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first=Seung-hyeon|script-title=ko:걸그룹 AOA '멤버 간 괴롭힘' 논란…권민아 "자해 시도도" VS 지민 "소설" 반박|url=https://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/07/03/2020070303182.html|website=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Company|access-date=July 3, 2020|date=July 3, 2020|language=ko}}</ref> Shin reportedly responded to the accusations by posting the word "fiction" to her [[Instagram Stories]] before deleting it shortly after. Kwon criticized the post, stating, "Fiction? It's too scary to say it's fiction."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yoon|first=Gi-baek|script-title=ko:권민아, AOA 지민 향해 사과 요구… 증거사진 공개까지 [전문]|url=https://www.edaily.co.kr/news/read?newsId=02358326625830912&mediaCodeNo=258|website=Edaily|access-date=July 3, 2020|date=July 3, 2020|language=ko}}</ref> On July 4, Shin posted an apology to her Instagram page while [[FNC Entertainment]] released a statement announcing that she had been removed from AOA and would be halting all entertainment activities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahn|first1=Ha-na|script-title=ko:지민, AOA 탈퇴...FNC 측 "모든 연예 활동 중단"(공식)|url=https://star.mbn.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&no=686588|website=MBN Star|publisher=[[Maeil Broadcasting Network]]|access-date=July 22, 2020|language=ko|date=July 5, 2020}}</ref>

=== Mental health issues ===
On August 6, 2020, Kwon posted a photograph on Instagram with the caption "Jinri-[[Korean honorifics#-A / -ya|ya]], I miss you", which was believed to be a reference to [[Sulli]] (Choi Jin-ri) of [[F(x) (group)|f(x)]], who committed suicide in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jung|first=An-jee|script-title=ko:권민아 "진리야 보고싶다" 故 설리 향한 그리움…밝은 근황 후 무슨 일 있나|url=https://www.sportschosun.com/news/news.htm?id=202008070100049890003131&ServiceDate=20200806|website=The Chosun Ilbo|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Company|access-date=August 6, 2020|language=ko|date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> In a separate post, Kwon revealed that she had recently been hospitalized after a relapse in self harm, following a [[KakaoTalk]] conversation she had with an FNC Entertainment representative who believed Shin's apology to be sincere. She expressed anger at the possibility of Shin resuming activities and finished the post by begging the company to be more considerate of their artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former AOA member Mina confesses to attempting self-harm as she continues to call out Jimin + FNC Entertainment reps|url=https://allkpop.com/article/2020/08/trigger-warning-former-aoa-member-mina-confesses-to-attempting-self-harm-as-she-continues-to-call-out-jimin-fnc-entertainment-reps|website=Allkpop|access-date=August 6, 2020|date=August 6, 2020}}</ref>  Two days later, in a since-deleted Instagram post, Kwon shared a graphic image of her slit wrist accompanied by an apparent [[suicide note]] stating
