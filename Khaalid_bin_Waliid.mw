Khalid binu walid was the commander of the Islamic army. He led the army to defeat the Romans, Jews and hypocrites in his time. He was the most bravest of all commanders that led the Islamic armies. Once, he showed bravery by leaving half of his army to help a war effort against the Romans even though the Romans had twice as many as Khalid binu walid army.
