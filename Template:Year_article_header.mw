However, this year saw the beginning of the '''''Gregorian Calendar switch''''', when the [[Papal bull]] known as ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' introduced the [[Gregorian calendar]], adopted by Spain, Portugal, the [[Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and most of present-day Italy from the start. In these countries, the year continued as normal until Thursday, [[October 4]]. However, the next day became Friday, [[October 15]] (like a [[common year starting on Friday]]), in those countries (France followed two months later, letting Sunday, [[December 9]] be followed by Monday, [[December 20]]). Other countries continued using the Julian calendar for decades or, in some cases, centuries.}}|<!-- Years On or After 1582 -->
