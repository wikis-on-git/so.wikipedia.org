The disputed status between Puntland and Somaliland has also meant that Sanaag as a whole may not have received all the available and apportioned aid from UN [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGO)s and [[Aid agency|aid agencies]]. The newly established Maakhir government has made this issue one of their first priorities, and appealed to the Warsangali [[Diaspora]] for assistance.<ref>[http://www.laasqoray.net/view_article.php?articleid=997 Jibrell has called the Diaspora to reach out to increasing IDPs in Sanaag and establish Civil Society Organisations]</ref>

===Government===
Due to drought conditions, administrative problems and threats of invasion from Somaliland, the government of Maakhir was dissolved on 6 April 2008 by governmental and presidential decree.  President Jibril promised a new government by June 2008, but Warsangelis decided instead to rally behind the campaign to elect General Ilkajir as President of Puntland.  By the swearing in of the new president of Puntland, Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, Maakhir had fully rejoined Puntland.

The two branches of government in Maakhir (the Parliament and the Executive) were led by:
* '''President Jibril Ali Salad''' - President of Maakhir
* '''Eng. Ahmed Guure Aadan''' - The House of Representative Speaker
