'''Ogaden''' (pronounced and often spelled ''Ogadēn'']]) is the international  name of the [[Somali Regional State]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The inhabitants are predominantly ethnic [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Muslim]]. The title "Somali Galbeed", which means "Western Somalia," is often preferred by some clans.

The region, which is around 400,000 square kilometres, borders [[Djibouti]], [[Kenya]], and [[Somalia]].<ref>Gebru Tareke, "The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited," in Board of Trustees, Boston University, ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies''. Boston University African Studies Center, 2000, p. 636.</ref> Important towns include [[Degehabur]] (Dhagaxbuur in Somali), [[Gode]] (Godey), [[Jijiga]] (Jigjiga), [[Kebri Dahar]] (Qabridahare),  [[Shilavo]] (Shilaabo) and [[Werder, Ethiopia|Werder]] (Wardheer).  



== History ==
[[image:Ethiopia-Somali.png|frame|right|Map of Ethiopia highlighting the [[Somali Region]].]]
Ogaden was part of the Muslim [[Ifat]] Sultanate in the 13th & beginning of the 14th centuries. The sultante's borders extened to the Shoa - Addis Ababa area. Then the region formed and had its own [[Adal]] kingdom from late 14th to  the last quarter of the 19th centuries. There was an endless conflict between Adal kingdom and the Christian Kingdom  of Abyssinia through centuries. during  the first halve of the 16th century, almost  all of  the modern  Ethiopian territory  became under  the  rule of Adal , when Imam Ahmed guray (the leader of Adal's  Army) conquered  Abyssinia.  <ref>''A History of the Ogaden (Western Somali) Struggle for Self - Determination'', first edition(London:Mohamed  Abdi , 2007), ps. 4-12.</ref> 
 

during the last quarter of the [[19th century]],The region was conquered (With the military and political assistance of Italy, Russia and France) by [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]]  and Ethiopia gained it by treaties in 1897.<ref>Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'' (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 113.</ref> 

In practice, Ethiopia exerted little administrative control east of Jijiga until 1934 because of the fierce resistance by Somalis in Ogaden. when an Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission attempted to demarcate the treaty boundary the people of the Ogaden uprised against the demarcation. This boundary is still disputed. <ref>Lewis, ''Modern History'', p. 61</ref>

The region was reunified with Italian Somaliland in 1936 by Italy. Following their conquest of [[Italian East Africa]], the British sought to let the Ogaden  be unified  with [[British Somaliland]] and the former [[Italian Somaliland]], to realize [[Greater Somalia]]  which was the desire of Ogaden Somalis.<ref>Bahru Zewde, p. 180.</ref> Ethiopia unsuccessfully pleaded before the [[London Conference of the Allied Powers]] to gain the Ogaden and [[Eritrea]] in [[1945]], but their persistent negotiations and pressure from the USA eventually persuaded the British in [[1948]] to abandon all of the Ogaden except for the northeastern part (called the [[Haud]]), and a corridor (called the Reserved Area) stretching from the Haud to French Somaliland (modern [[Djibouti]]). The British ceded these last parts to Ethiopia in [[1954]].<ref>Bahru Zewde, p. 181.</ref>

In the late [[1950s]], internal unrest in the Ogaden resumed. The Western Somalia Liberation Front, spurred by Muktal Dahir, used guerrilla tactics to resist Ethiopian rule.  WSLF (with Somali troops' support)freed 90% of the region in the late 1970s [[Ogaden War]. During the  Ethiopia's reoccupation of the Ogaden, massive civilians were killed, the Whole villages and towns were razed to the ground. 

In [[2007]], the [[Ethiopian Army]] launched a [[2007 Ogaden conflict|military crackdown in Ogaden]]. The main rebel group is the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] under its Chairman [[Mohamed O. Osman]], which is fighting to liberate the Ogaden from what they see as Ethiopian occupation. The Somalis who inhabit Ogaden claim that the Ethiopian military kill great number of civilians, and destroy the livelihood of many of the ethnic Somalis.  Numerous international rights organizations accuse Ethiopian regime of committing abuses and crimes that "violate laws of war,"<ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/02/ethiop16327.htm Ethiopia: Crackdown in East Punishes Civilians (Human Rights Watch, 4-7-2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as a recent report by the [[Human Rights Watch]] indicates.
The ONLF attacked a Chinese Oil company in Ogaden during the April 2007 killing 65 Ethiopian troops  and 9 Chinese workers.<ref>{{cite web
