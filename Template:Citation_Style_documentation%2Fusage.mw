Copy a blank version to use. Almost all parameter names are supported only in lower case (some initialisms, such as {{para|isbn}} have upper-case aliases like {{para|ISBN}}, which are acceptable for use). Use the "|" (pipe) character between each parameter. Unused parameters may be deleted to avoid clutter in the edit window. Some samples on this documentation page may include the current date. If the date is not current, then {{purge|purge}} the page.
