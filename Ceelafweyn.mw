==Maduuno==



Maduno is an old ruined city lying about seven and a half km east of 
El-afwein. Nobody has ever unveiled the mysteries surrounding it. 
This is due to the fact that our people (Somali) were oral society without written lan-guage to record their events, culture and masterpieces. 
 
This city lies on a small hill between Caday-musbah River (dry) and mawaley. Caday-musbah is a compound word which means the illuminated salvador perisa. Caday (salvador perisa) and Musbah (lamp) probably derived from the Arabic words. Before you reach the proper maduno, you would notice another ruined city on the banks. I believe that the people of maduno first settled there and were devastated by over flooding of the river causing a lot of damage. The survivors might have sought a saver area and started to build another new town where maduno stands today. 
  
Going back to Caday-musbah, i believe that there was a large Quran school and children used to memorize all the Quran verses after they burn huge amounts of logs for illumination. So, the people passing by from afar at night thought that this area was illuminated by lamps. I doubt how modern archaeologist would accept this.
The road linking to EL-afwein and Dararweine is close to maduno. The main portion of the city is in the southern part and is quiet larger than  yonder in the north. The city has melancholic appearance that makes one to contemplate how this mighty workmanship vanished thoroughly without leaving behind any living traces. Buildings are devastated and their rubbles are seen 
  

Everywhere as they were deliberately disintegrated. The loose heaps of rocks and shale in some places that are littered the ground could almost been decayed remains of some living rooms, courtyards and markets that died ages ago, before the Somalis who settled around it came to break the silence once more. There are multitudes of graves beside the crumbled buildings. One would have the opinion that the inhabitants of maduno were besieged by powerful hostile communities who forbade the dead ones to be buried in the nearby fields.
 

The only thing that we could deduce from the condition of maduno is that its people were Muslims when we notice the great mosque at the centre of the city and graves laid facing towards Mecca. The walls of the mosque stand mostly unharmed. The niches where the Quranic volumes were kept are in place and the chamber of the imam is still standing. But the mosque is desecrated by birds, lizards and other small animals. 

The shapes, sizes and formation differ from one house to other. Some are rectangular, some are square and others are circular. In some houses you would find larger rooms as if they were used as court yards or sitting rooms.
Some of the stones of the buildings are corroded by weather over the years while others are fused together. It is spectacular in a way and sombre in the other. Most of its build-ings are ruined. However, some parts of the walls seem to have resisted the obliteration of weather and other disaster agents. Perhaps maduno flourished over a period of time as Eldorado or Timbuktu before it reached at the end of the road. 
 

I believe the city was built by Arab merchants who traded slaves ,ivory and ostrich feathers and why it was deserted this was a mystery. The Arabs may have abandoned when they found the ivory and ostrich feather trade was falling off, or when they discovered that the local gala people who settled there before the Somalis, would bring their goods to the coast and sell just as cheap there.
The once crowded houses, busy markets or shops are replaced by many different sorts of animals like Jeroas (Wallo), Squirrels (Dagagaale), Mongooses (SHuuqshuuq) and Porcupine (Caana-qub) running to the ruins for shelter. You may also see birds like Bustard (Jugley), Sand grouse (Faqow) guinea fowl (digirin) and Hoopoe (Hudhud) scratching in the dust with their claws and pecking with their peaks.
Between the buildings and their suburbs, trees are grown inside the houses like Acacia bussei (Galool), Acacia Spirocarpa (Qudhac), Zizyphypus mautritiana (Gobka), Termenilia (Daray), Salvador persia (Caday) and others.
I wonder why this great city wasn’t mentioned in the stories rehearsed by Somali travel-lers who used to tell strange stories, strange animals, bitter wars, devastated cities and glorious men. They have also mentioned old cities like Amud, Zeila, Bulahar and others. Maduno was not mentioned in any of these stories. Thus it remained mysterious for a time immemorial. Even strange women like Arawelo and Deg-der were made popular in those stories.
To my knowledge no archaeologist, anthropologist or ethnographer have ever visited here.
 it is among the unreported historical sites in the east like Godanod, Gamaso, Alibahay, Godalo, Gaminley, Gelweyta, Waqderiya, Harsho and many, many others. 

It is widely believed by the elderly people in this area that maduno has the same age as sheikh and Alibahay (near Hudon) and they had the same plight in a same period. There is a legend which says that three towns were ruled by a sacred saint who had the power to fly to these towns to monitor their prayers everyday in scheduled times. All the three cities were destroyed at once. Nobody can tell exactly what happened to them. They might have been inflicted by famine or epidemic diseases. Some people believed they were caranged by hostile enemies. It is obvious that nobody survived.  If some of them were left alive, the history of the city wouldn’t be lost so easily in that way because memories are hard to erase. Who took responsibility of burying corpses? Where have they gone to, then? Were they slain too? If the dead bodies were not buried they would be crunched and devoured by prowling hyenas and vultures. 

If we knew necromancy, we would contact the tombs and they might possibly help us unveil their secrets and how they remained in perdition or ruin for many centuries. Lastly, i appeal to every somalilander to dedicate some of his time to have a research on this lost unreported city. I also appeal to the ministry of tourism to employ personnel to take   care to avoid further damage by expanding illegal land ownership.
