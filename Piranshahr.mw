[[West Azarbaijan]] Rural Cooperative Organization has bought some 470,000 tons of wheat, valued at Rls.840&nbsp;billion, from farmers since the beginning of the year.{{specify|date=August 2015}} Among West Azarbaijan cities, Piranshar is considered a fine example in agriculture improvements. Since 2002, most of the investments in the city are made in the agricultural sector.

The plant, in the course of years of its activity, has been constantly renovated by making use of the existing capabilities in the plant.
