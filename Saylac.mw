{{Translation}}
Zeila (also spelled Seyla`, Seelaac, Zaila, Zeyla, Zeylac, Zayla, Séyla, Seylac) (Somali: Saylac) is a port city on the Gulf of Aden coast in the [[Awdal]] Region of northern Soomaaliya, and as of 1991 is part of the self-proclaimed but internationally unrecognized Republic of [[Somaliland]].

It is located at 11.3539° N 43.4739° E, surrounded on three sides by the sea; landward the country is unbroken desert for some fifty miles. It is close to Djibouti. [[Berbera]] is 170 miles southeast of Zeila, while the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] city of [[Harar]] is 200 miles to the west.

The town is known for its offshore islands, coral reef and mangroves. Its lack of a sufficient supply of good drinking water has historically hobbled its commercial value, pointed out as late as 1698, (in this instance in a Dutch East India Company report).[1]
