I (a proud english south african) disagree with the fact that people say that this place is the most dangerous place because if a Somalian person can say that cape town is the most dangerous they must be out of their heads!!!

Cape Town is WAY better than the whole of Somalia, which is basically a war zone and has a hundred times more poverty than south Africa
