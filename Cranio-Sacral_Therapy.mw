'''Cranio-sacral therapy''' (from the Latin ''cranium: skull; sacral: the sacrum (os sacrum) relating'' to: "skull-sacrum therapy", also '''craniosacral therapy''' ) is an alternative form of treatment that developed from osteopathy . It is a manual procedure that involves manipulating the skull , neck , hyoid bone , thorax , spine , sacrum , diaphragm , pelvis , and feetto be executed. There are only a few studies on craniosacral therapy. There is no scientific evidence of its effectiveness . Cranio-sacral therapy is also highly controversial within osteopathy.

Medical research has not found good evidence that CST or cranial osteopathy provide any health benefits and they can be harmful, especially when used on children or infants. The basic assumptions of CST are not true, and practitioners make conflicting and mutually exclusive diagnoses of the same patients. Basically, craniosacral therapy can improve your back by relieving pressure and stress on it <ref>Etienne Peirsman: ''[https://www.peirsmancraniosacral.com/ Best Craniosacral Therapy]  Us'': ''Peirsmancraniosacral.''

CST was invented by John Upledger in the 1970s as an offshoot of cranial osteopathy developed by William Garner Sutherland in the 1930s .

Daaweynta Craniosacral waxay ka timid osteopathy craniosacral, kaas oo uu aasaasay dhakhtarka osteopathic American William Garner Sutherland oo ah "Osteopathy in the Cranial Field" oo noqday qayb muhiim ah oo ka mid ah osteopathy sida osteopathy craniosacral. Daaweynta Cranio-sacral waxay heshay qaabkeeda hadda iyada oo loo marayo osteopath John E. Upledger oo leh buugga Craniosacral Therapy ee 1983, tarjumaadda Jarmalku waxay xaq u leedahay buug-gacmeedka daaweynta Craniosacral I. xuubka dural (dura mater) oo leh soo noqnoqoshada qiyaastii sideed jeer daqiiqadii wuxuuna ku sharaxay daahfurkan aasaaska osteopathy craniosacral, kaas oo uu sii horumariyay nidaamka craniosacral. Saldhigga farsamada daawaynta ayaa ahayd palpation (baaritaan taabasho).

Daaweynta Cranio-sacral waxay ku salaysan tahay, waxyaabo kale, iyada oo loo maleynayo in garaaca laxanka ee dareeraha cerebrospinal ( khamriga cerebrospinalis ), waxa loogu yeero "habka neefsashada aasaasiga ah" PAM (ama habka neefsashada aasaasiga ah - PRM), waxay saameeyaan unugyada dibadda. waxaana loo gudbiyaa lafaha sidaas awgeedna lagu dareemi karo garaacid . Ka soo horjeeda ra'yiga sayniska (anatomy), lafaha gaarka ah ee calvaria ayaa sidoo kale loo tixgeliyaa inay yihiin kuwo la guuri karo marka loo eego midba midka kale ee dadka waaweyn.

Kalfadhiga daawaynta craniosacral ee caadiga ah, macaamiishu waxay caadi ahaan jiifsadaan iyagoo si buuxda u xidhan miiska daawaynta. Waxay qaadataa qiyaastii hal saac celcelis ahaan. Daaweeyuhu wuxuu ku shaqeeyaa calaacasha ama faraha isaga oo inta badan leh xoog jilicsan ama cadaadis yar. Markaad sidaa sameysid, ama u gudub jihada loo arko inay tahay mid nafsi ahaan macquul ah, ama xiisadda unugyada dareenka ayaa la raacayaa si loo yareeyo. Dhinaca lama huraanka ah waa garaacista iyo beddelka laxanka craniosacral.

Scientific studies show that the movements and pressures of the cerebrospinal fluid react dynamically to the pressure conditions in the body. This leads to characteristic pulse and respiration-synchronous changes as well as to fluctuations when coughing or when performing the Valsalva maneuver . The existence of a CSF wave that is effective throughout the body and the effectiveness of craniosacral therapy could not be proven. Studies on the effectiveness (see medical effectiveness ) or mode of action of craniosacral therapy have so far been rated as insufficient in international medical journals due to methodological deficiencies.  A review by Jäkel and Hauenschild  from 2012 shows that although there are individual high-quality studies that report on pain-relieving and well-being-enhancing effects, the study situation as a whole does not provide any reliable information on the clinical effectiveness of craniosacral - Therapy allowed. In a systematic review, Edzard Ernst was also unable to find any evidence of an effect going beyond non-specific effects.  A review from 2016, based on the available data, came to the conclusion that this form of therapy was neither relevant for the diagnosis nor for the treatment of patients. 

In previous studies, there was no significant agreement on a detected rhythm between two therapists touching the same person at the same time. In addition, the movement of the cranial sutures determined by imaging methods in the micro range is so small that it clearly falls short of the discrimination ability of the fine tactile sensors of a human hand.
