'''Oscar Gutierrez'''<ref>http://www.gerweck.net/reymysterio.htm</ref><ref name="official"/> (born [[December 11]], [[1974]]) better known by his [[ring name]] '''Rey Mysterio''', is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] wrestling on its ''[[Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. Despite competing as a [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] for most of his career, he is a former [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]], as well as a record-setting eight-time [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|Cruiserweight Champion]]. 

Mysterio is known for having a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|high flying style]], which helped kick-start the cruiserweight revolution in the United States, in the late 1990s during his time in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]. 

==Career==
Born in [[San Diego, California]], Gutierrez trained for pro wrestling with his uncle, who wrestled under the name [[Rey Misterio, Sr.|Rey Misterio]]. He debuted as a wrestler on [[April 30]] [[1989]] at the age of 14 in a small church in [[Tijuana, Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. Technically, he was too young to receive a license, but enforcement was generally low. He began a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Dionicio Castellanos|Psicosis]] (who had also been trained by Rey Misterio, Sr.) using the [[ring name]] '''Colibrí''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[hummingbird]]). The feud lasted several years, continuing even after Mysterio's career moved to the United States of America.

When Gutierrez turned 18, his uncle allowed him to use the ring name '''Rey Misterio, Jr.'''. In [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) he feuded with [[Juventud Guerrera]] including a tag match with [[Rey Mysterio]] and Rey Misterio taking on Juventud and his father, [[Fuerza Guerrera|Mr. Guerrera]].

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===  
In 1995, Misterio defeated [[Psicosis]] during their debut match on [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). This match was their first real impact in [[United States|American]] professional wrestling - although they had previously been seen on the WCW promoted [[When Worlds Collide (wrestling)|When Worlds Collide]] [[pay-per-view]]. Misterio, along with a number of other [[Lucha libre|luchadores]], became a featured attraction in ECW. Misterio would later appear at the first two WWE-promoted [[WWE One Night Stand|ECW One Night Stand]] reunion shows.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996-2001)===   
====1996-1997====
Misterio went on to gain fame in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1996, where he was the flagship of the new "Cruiserweight Revolution" in the United States. The spelling of his name was partially [[anglicization|anglicized]] as "Rey M'''y'''sterio Jr.", to further market him as a "mystery man." Mysterio had many famous matches with [[Yoshihiro Asai|Ultimo Dragon]], [[Dean Malenko]], Psicosis, [[Eddie Guerrero]], and Juventud Guerrera. He would go on to hold the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] five times.

Mysterio quickly made an impact in WCW with his first Cruiserweight title reign. In October 1997, at [[Halloween Havoc#1997|Halloween Havoc]], Mysterio won his second Cruiserweight Championship from real-life friend Eddie Guerrero in a "title vs. mask" match. The match was so highly acclaimed for its utter fluency and technicality that it was voted Match of the Year. At this point, Mysterio was a staple of WCW's roster.   

====1998-1999====
After much feuding, Mysterio would lose the Cruiserweight title to [[Chris Jericho]] at [[Souled Out#1998|WCW/nWo Souled Out]] on [[January 24]] [[1998]]. After the match, Jericho continued the beating using a toolbox found at ringside. This would put Mysterio on the sidelines for six months before making his return at [[Bash at the Beach#1998|Bash at the Beach 1998]] where he defeated Chris Jericho for the championship. The next night however, the result was overturned and the belt returned to Jericho due to the interference of Dean Malenko.

In 1998, Eddie Guerrero formed a stable known as the [[Latino World Order]] (a spin off of [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]) that included nearly every luchador in the promotion. Mysterio continually refused to join. He was finally forced to join after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. As the two factions of nWo reformed - nWo Hollywood and nWo Wolfpac - they demanded the LWO's disbanding. Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was physically beaten as a result.

At [[SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl IX|Superbrawl IX]] Mysterio, alongside with [[Konnan]] would lose a tag team "hair vs. mask match" against the [[The Outsiders (WCW)|The Outsiders]] forcing Rey Mysterio, Jr. to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him of the news.

Mysterio would later become a "giant killer" by scoring upset victories over towering, powerhouse performers like [[Kevin Nash]], [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], and [[Scott Norton]]. He would also begin a successful tag team with [[Peter Gruner|Billy Kidman]] and join [[Master P]]'s [[No Limit Soldiers]]. After Master P's departure from WCW, a new stable known as the [[Filthy Animals]] formed including [[Konnan]], Eddie Guerrero, Kidman, and Mysterio.

On a 1999 edition of ''WCW Monday Nitro'' Mysterio beat Ric Flair via DQ.
 
====2000-2001====   
Mysterio remained a steady performer, and eventually joined the [[New Blood]] faction in early 2000 opposing the "[[Millionaires Club]]." Throughout WCW's final months Mysterio and Kidman would then feud with tag teams such as [[Misfits in Action]] and [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]]. Together, they would win the new [[WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship|WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Titles]] on the final edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' before WCW was sold to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 2001. This would be Mysterio's last TV appearance for over a year.

===X Wrestling Federation===
For a short time Rey wrestled for the short lived [[X Wrestling Federation|XWF]] promotion.

===Independent Circuit===
During this time, Rey also made some appearances for the CMLL promotion in Mexico, wrestling without his mask.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002-present)===
====2002-2003====
In 2002, Rey signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and promos were aired hyping his debut. In WWE, he is known only as '''Rey Mysterio''', with no '[[Jr.]]' suffix (just as Chavo Guererro, Jr. and others are).  Vince McMahon also requested that Mysterio wear his mask again. In Mexico, one could be fined or even have their license suspended in lucha libre by the Box y Lucha Commission for this; there, once a wrestler loses his mask, they cannot traditionally regain it. Mysterio began his WWE career on [[July 25]], 2002 on ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], in a match against [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] which Rey would win. After, he joined [[John Cena]] and [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] to feud with [[Kurt Angle]] and [[The Un-Americans]] ([[Lance Storm]], [[Jason Reso|Christian]] and [[Andrew "Test" Martin|Test]]).

On November 7, 2002, Rey won the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] with [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] in a match against [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]], but after losing the titles at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] to Los Guerreros, they stopped tagging together. At [[WrestleMania XIX]] Rey challenged [[Matt Hardy]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] but was unsuccessful after interference by [[Shannon Moore]]. Mysterio finally beat Hardy for the title in [[June 5]], 2003, in a match on Smackdown that took place in Anaheim. He later lost the title to [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]], with whom he feuded with until January.

====2004-2005====
Rey regained the cruiserweight title on the first episode of ''SmackDown!'' in January 2004. 

Rey later began to feud with [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] then they faced off at [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]] for the Cruiserweight title. Then he battled Chavo's father [[Chavo Classic]] over the Cruiserweight Championship, in which he won back the title. During this time, Mysterio teamed on occasion with [[Rob Van Dam]], or [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] to face off against the [[Dudley Boyz]], and at one stage won a gauntlet match to get a shot at the [[WWE Championship]] title on the SmackDown after [[WrestleMania XX]]. But he lost the title match against [[Eddie Guerrero]].

However, while Rey Mysterio was Cruiserweight Champion, Spike Dudley turned heel after plowing Rey through a table and joined the other Dudleys before taking the Cruiserweight title from Mysterio on [[July 29]], 2004.

Rey continued to team with Rob Van Dam, and won the WWE Tag Team Championship from [[Kenzo Suzuki]] and [[René Goguen|René Dupreé]] on [[December 7]] before losing the titles to [[The Basham Brothers]] a month later after Van Dam got injured. Rey would team up with [[Eddie Guerrero]] to win the titles back from the Bashams at [[No Way Out (2005)|No Way Out 2005]]. In a departure from traditional [[booking (professional wrestling)|booking]], the new champions did not defend their titles at [[WrestleMania 21]], but instead had a match against each other which Rey won.

This led to a storyline in which Guerrero [[turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and beat him up after abandoning him during a rematch against the heel tag team [[MNM]] for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Then after a No DQ match against Chavo, Eddie came out and hit a [[brainbuster]] on the steel steps, which left Rey lain on the floor. Eddie was becoming increasingly frustrated that he could not beat Mysterio. 

[[Image:Rey3 WrestlemaniaRevenge.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Mysterio during a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] [[house show]].]]

Guerrero and Rey continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Rey shared involving Rey's son, Dominic. He threatened to go public with the secret unless Rey deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that he was Dominic's ([[kayfabe]]) biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Rey was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominic as a baby with Rey and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominic, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam 2005]], Rey defeated Guerrero in a [[Ladder match]] for the custody of Dominic. 

Rey then became engaged in a brief feud with [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] with JBL eventually coming out the victor at [[WWE No Mercy#2005|No Mercy 2005]]. On [[November 13]] [[2005]], [[Eddie Guerrero]] was found dead in his hotel room in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. That same day at a WWE "Super Show" where ''SmackDown!'' and ''RAW'' were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Eddie, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so no one could see his face). Mysterio went on to defeat [[Shawn Michaels]] in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Eddie Guerrero. This began a span of weeks wherein Mysterio, along with friends [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]], dedicated their victories to Eddie either by word or by using his moves during his matches; "Eddie" chants continued to follow Rey and Chavo Guerrero in their matches for a few months.

Mysterio participated in the main event of [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]] as part of Team SmackDown! along with [[Randy Orton]], ([[Eddie Guerrero]]'s replacement), [[Bobby Lashley]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[John Layfield|JBL]] who defeated Team RAW ([[Shawn Michaels]], [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], [[Paul Wight|the Big Show]], [[Carly Colón|Carlito]], and [[Chris Mordetzky|Chris Masters]]). On the Tuesday after Survivor Series, Mysterio faced Big Show from ''RAW'', in a match billed as "[[David]] vs. [[Goliath (Bible)|Goliath]]" in a [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] special show.

The match stemmed from Mysterio eliminating Big Show at Survivor Series, and ended as a "no contest" when Big Show's tag team partner, Kane, interfered in the match. Mysterio continued to feud with ''RAW''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]], even finding a tag team partner in [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] who, along with Mysterio, would be set to face ''RAW'' [[Kane and The Big Show]] in a tag match at [[WWE Armageddon#2005|Armageddon 2005]].

Before Armageddon, Batista and Mysterio defeated [[MNM]] to become ''SmackDown!''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s new WWE Tag Team Champions, in a match they both dedicated to Eddie Guerrero. Now the Tag Team Champions, Mysterio and Batista's match with Big Show and Kane was billed as "Champions vs. Champions". Mysterio and Batista lost this ''RAW vs SmackDown!'' match when Kane pinned Mysterio after a [[chokeslam]].

On the [[December 30]] [[2005]] edition of ''SmackDown!'', MNM invoked their rematch clause, defeating Batista and Mysterio with help from the returning [[Mark Henry]] to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] after an assault on Batista by Henry. Rey and Batista lost a steel cage match in an effort to reclaim the titles the following week, again courtesy of interference by Mark Henry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12302005/|title=A shocking return leads to new Champs - Smackdown archive 2005|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01062006/|title=Making statements - Smackdown archive 2006|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref>

====2006-2007====
[[Image:Rey-SD-HS-06.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Mysterio during his first reign as [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]].]]
On [[January 29]] [[2006]] Rey Mysterio competed in the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble]], entering in the number 2 position, and later eliminating [[Randy Orton]] to win the match . By winning the Royal Rumble, Mysterio earned a World Heavyweight title shot at that years [[WrestleMania 22|WrestleMania]]. By lasting over 62 minutes in the match, Mysterio also set a Royal Rumble record for longevity and size.<ref name="wwemagoct07">{{cite journal|title=By The Numbers|journal=WWE Magazine|issue=16|pages=10|year=2007|month=October}}</ref>

Rey dedicated his performance at the Royal Rumble to Eddie Guerrero. After his win, he was congratulated by [[Chris Benoit]], [[Dean Malenko]], [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] - all close friends and family of Eddie Guerrero.

During the [[February 3]] [[2006]] episode of SmackDown, an upset Randy Orton interrupted Mysterio's victory speech. Orton challenged Mysterio to a match for his WrestleMania World title shot. As Rey looked upward for guidance on this decision Orton verbally attacked him and the memory of Guerrero, saying "Eddie ain't in heaven, Eddie's 'down there'-- IN HELL!" Mysterio attacked Orton and later accepted the challenge.

Randy Orton defeated Rey Mysterio at [[No Way Out (2006)|No Way Out]], illegally using the ropes to get the pin. Having lost the title shot at WrestleMania 22, Rey went backstage with a few members of Guerrero's close family. However, on the next edition of SmackDown, General Manager [[Theodore Long]] added Rey, making the match a Triple Threat match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight title]]. At WrestleMania 22, Rey faced off against both Randy Orton and then-World Heavyweight Champion [[Kurt Angle]]. Mysterio won the match by pinning Randy Orton using the West Coast Pop to win his first World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania22/matches/141602621/results/|title=Wrestlemania 22 Match Results|accessdate=2006-04-02|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref>

On the [[April 7]] [[2006]] edition of SmackDown, Rey Mysterio - who was billed as being an "[[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] champion" - made his first World Heavyweight title defense against Randy Orton. Mysterio went on to retain his title again during a WrestleMania rematch on SmackDown against Kurt Angle, three weeks later. The week before the title defense took place saw the start of a feud between the then-United States Champion [[John Bradshaw Layfield]] and Mysterio. The rivalry kicked off after JBL stated he deserved the World Heavyweight title during his celebration of becoming the U.S. Champion. 

The feud with JBL saw Mysterio face off against any opponent of JBL's choosing in the three weeks leading up to his title match against Mysterio at [[Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day 2006]]. Mysterio was defeated by [[Mark Henry]] and [[The Great Khali]] in separate non-title matches before facing ''RAW''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] in a match that went to a no contest. Mysterio retained his title against JBL at Judgement Day. JBL lost the [[WWE United States Championship|US Championship]] to [[Bobby Lashley]] five days later on SmackDown after being tricked by Mysterio to take on all comers like he had. This led JBL to vow that if he didn't win his rematch against Mysterio, he would quit ''SmackDown!''. In the main event of the evening Mysterio won and retained the World Heavyweight Championship, causing JBL to ([[kayfabe]]) leave ''SmackDown!'', until [[One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], when JBL announced he would return as color commentator.

It was revealed that Rey would have to defend his title against ECW wrestler [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]]. In the weeks leading up to his title defense, Mysterio defeated WWE Cruiserweight Champion [[Gregory Helms]] in a Champion vs. Champion match and was defeated by [[Rob Van Dam]] at ''WWE vs. ECW Head to Head'' on [[June 7]] [[2006]]. Immediately after WWE vs. ECW, WWE.com reported that [[Paul Heyman]] approached Mysterio about switching brands to ECW. Rey announced on the [[June 9]] [[2006]] edition of SmackDown that he would stay "home", on WWE's ''SmackDown!''. At One Night Stand, Mysterio (who was wearing a mask with the letters "ECW" written on the back, despite being a face and booed by ECW fans) retained his title in a hard fought match after he and Sabu were ruled unable to continue following a triple jump DDT through a table from Sabu.

Mysterio would later defend his title against Mark Henry. Mysterio won the match, after Chavo Guerrero came to the ring as the referee was down and hit the "World's Strongest Man" with a steel chair. When the referee regained consciousness, Rey had used a trick of Eddie Guerrero's and pretended to be knocked out and left the challenger holding the chair and eventually won via DQ. Mysterio would then start a feud with [[Booker Huffman|King Booker]] after Booker won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. King Booker attacked Rey from behind backstage with the help of Booker's wife Queen Sharmell. The attack was not shown live and was during the beating of Mark Henry by Batista. The footage was aired the week later on SmackDown and was followed by Mysterio attacking the King and his "court."

This rivalry continued for several weeks and saw Mysterio defeating King Booker's royal court member [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] on an edition of SmackDown, moments before attacking the challenger and hitting him with a 619 around the steel post. During ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', Mysterio defeated King Booker in a six man tag match and again days later on SmackDown in singles action. At [[WWE The Great American Bash#2006|The Great American Bash]], Rey lost the World Heavyweight Championship to King Booker after Chavo Guerrero turned on Rey and hit him with a steel chair, who would also cost him his rematch at SmackDown. Then on one edition of SmackDown, Rey Mysterio challenged Chavo Guerrero in an [["I Quit" match]]. In that match, Chavo injured (kayfabe) Mysterio's knee, causing him to take time off wrestling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10202006/articles/reyunderknife|title=Rey under the knife - Smackdown archive 10/20/06|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref>

Mysterio made a successful in-ring return at [[SummerSlam (2007)|SummerSlam 2007]], defeating [[Chavo Guerrero Jr|Chavo Guerrero]] with the 619, after Guerrero had obsessed over Mysterio's return, wanting to injure Mysterio again. On the [[August 31]] edition of SmackDown, Mysterio won a "Championship Competition" to become the number 1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, defeating [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]. On the [[September 7]] edition of [[WWE Friday Night Smackdown|SmackDown]], Mysterio had a [["I Quit" match]] with [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. Mysterio won the match by hitting Guerrero's knee with a chair repeatedly, winning the match in a similar manner to which Mysterio had been put out of action. Mysterio then began a feud with [[The Great Khali]] which would lead to a match at [[Unforgiven (2007)|Unforgiven]] where he would face Khali for the World Heavyweight Championship (the match was eventually made a Triple Threat match involving Batista) but was unsuccessful in capturing the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/matches/|title=Unforgiven 2007 Results|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=WWE}}</ref>. Rey would then begin a feud with Finlay, an opponent chosen by [[John Layfield|JBL]]. The rivalry was marked as "Fight vs. Flight", a competition between the two contrasting fighting styles of both wrestlers - Finlay's physicality, versus the high-flying Rey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09212007//|title=Beyond the matrimony - Smackdown archive 2007|accessdate=2007-09-21|publisher=WWE}}</ref> On [[October 28]], after fighting to a no-contest at [[No Mercy (2007)|No Mercy]] followed by a double-disqualification in a #1 Contender match for Batista's [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight title]] on the next SmackDown program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10122007/articles/whosnumberone|title=Who's No. 1? - SmackDown archive 2007|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=WWE}}</ref>([[The Undertaker]] would succeed the pair), he defeated Finlay in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Stretcher Match|Stretcher match]] at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/matches/526761033/results/|title=Rolling to victory - Cyber Sunday 2007 Match Results|accessdate=2007-10-28|publisher=WWE}}</ref>

Mysterio then began a feud with [[Alvin Burke Jr.|MVP]], defeating him via countout at [[WWE Armageddon#2007|Armageddon]]. MVP retained the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] since titles cannot change hands per this stipulation.

# {{note|1}} Three way match involving Angel Mortal.
# {{note|2}} The match was scheduled to be [[Konnan]] & Mysterio vs. [[Kevin Nash]] & [[Lex Luger]], but Luger claimed to be injured and was replaced by [[Scott Hall]].  The wager was Mysterio's mask vs. Elizabeth's (who was managing the [[The Outsiders (WCW)|Outsiders]] at that point) hair. Since joining [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]], Mysterio has begun wearing the mask again, and [[retcon|WWE makes no mention of his ever having lost it]].  Although, footage of him without his mask on, is aired on WWE's On Demand service, [[WWE 24/7]].

On [[March 19]] [[2007]], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' posted on its website an article in its continuing series investigating a steroid and [[Growth hormone treatment|HGH]] ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Mysterio who was alleged to have obtained [[nandrolone]] and [[stanozolol]].<ref name=HGH-SI>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/03/19/wrestlers/index.html|title=Wrestlers allegedly tied to drug ring|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> WWE has since made a statement on this situation, mentioning that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in February 2006.<ref name=HGH-WWE>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/si|title=A Statement From World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=March 22|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Other Media==
On the fourth episode of the second season of [[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]], the character [[Monica Dawson|Monica]] sees Mysterio give Randy Orton the 619 on a televised match. Later in the show, she uses her power to recreate any physical activity she sees to perform a modified 619, similar to Mysterio giving the 619 around a ringpost, to stop a robbery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/overtheropes/news/619onheroes|title=The 619 saves the day|author=Kara A.
