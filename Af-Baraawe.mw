Barawani-language was formerly a vernacular language spoken in Baraawe and its neighbouring towns,it is still spoken there though the various tribes of somali community have previously settled in the town but that has not suppresed the language.The barawani-language is said to have developed from portuguese,but undoubtedly it is heard "kila siku",which is a swahili phrase.So the speaking-people settled in the country approximately in the 19th century,and they are pacifists...........
