Damascus(دمشق transliteration: Dimashq, also commonly known as  ash-Shām) is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world (see section: Ancient history), before Al Fayyum, and Gaziantep. Its current population is estimated at about 4.5 million.[citation needed] The city is a governorate by itself, and the capital of the governorate of Rif Dimashq (Rural Damascus).
