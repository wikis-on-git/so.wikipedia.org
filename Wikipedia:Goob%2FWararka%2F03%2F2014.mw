The Catalan-speaking world... Want to find out more? From March 16 to April 15 we will organise the [[:en:Wikipedia:Catalan culture challenge|Catalan Culture Challenge]], a Wikipedia editing contest in which victory will go to those who start and improve the greatest number of articles about 50 key figures of Catalan culture. You can take part by creating or expanding articles on these people in your native language (or any other one you speak). It would be lovely to have you on board. :-)

We look forward to seeing you!
