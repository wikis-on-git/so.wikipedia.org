 magacaygu waa maxamed axmed maxmuud waxan dinka codsanayaa inaad bogga soo galisaan maansadda siinlayda

== Ku Saabsan Asal raaca boqortooyada aad ka hadleysid ==


Asalaamu Aleyku Wa rahmatu laahi wa barakaatuhu.

Ilaah hanooga danbi dhaafo wixii aan ula kaca aheyn oo afkeena ka soo dhex baxa umadana nasabiyadooda aan meel uga dhaceyno.


Walaal arintan aad soo qortay ma u heysaa tixraac?

Ma kugu raacsan yihiin qoladaa tiri waqti aaneyn jirin bey boqortooyo lahaayeen?

Ma been abuur baad rabtaa dadka inaa taariikh uga dhigtid ?

Ilaah ka baq fidnada waxa ka xun ma jiraan, xataa hadaa dhimatid waxaadan hubin ama malawaal aad dad meel kaga dhaceysid danbi jaariya buu kuu noqon ama dadkaa ka gashay oo maalayiin ah waa inaa mid mid danbi dhaaf u weydiisataa, hadaba ka fakir intaadan falin dacan lama sameeyo oo qolo waxay aheyn laguma tilmaamo


Qoladaa sheegeysid oo umar wilinwili la yiraah oo laheyd Walashma dynasty oo Cadal ka talin jirtay maaha Ogaadeen, wey sheegtaan ma jiraan qolo Ogaadeen ah oo taqaan ama ogaadeenka xataa magacooda ma ay maqlin seey marka Ogaadeen ku yeelan karaan boqortooyadas , mise waxaad is leedahay Soomaali wey amaan jecelyihiinee sidaa qoladaas ugu dar Ogaadeen?

Walaal kuma fahmin, hadii ay jiraan xaqiiq aad u heysid bal la imoow in qabiilka Umar wilinwili la yiraah ay Ogaadeen yihiin; markaa boqortooyadan Ogaadeen baa lahaa hadaa xaqiiq la timaadidi, mideeda kale Ogaadeen waa Darood Awoowgood ay ka soo farcameen (Isma'il bin Ibrahim bin AbdiSamad Al-Shafici Al-Jeberti Al-Zabidi)baa dhashay 1322 boqortooyadan waxay bilaabatay 1328 sidey ku yeelan karaan boqortooyadaas markuu awoowgood jiray lix sano deganaana kuna dhintay Zabid?.
Mideeda kale hadeyba jirin qabiil la yiraah umar wilin wili oo taariikh walbo qoreyso iney dadkaas aahaayeen dadkii loo yaqaanay Argobba macanheedu ahaa carab timi oo ahaayeen dadkii ka farcamay carabtii asxaabihii dhulka xabshada hore u timi casrigii rasuulka caleyhi salaam hjalkan tariikhdooda ka akhriso iyagana meel ha uga dhicin Ogaadeena meel ha uga dhicin Jahligi waa cadowga dadka iska horkeena marin habaabina ha ku sameeyn sida ninka la baxay James Dahl oo Soomaalida siyabo badan isugu dayayo inuu ma rin habaabiyo asagioo markii reference la weediiyo isla pagekiisa iyo wuxuu qoray kuu soo galinayo waa tan taariikhda Argoba people oo qoran iyadoo carabtii hore qortayna waad heleysaa. I hope if you are well educated and respect others you wouldn't post a false history and stop misleading people as Mr James Dahl do.

Ogaadeen waa dad sharaf leh uma baahno amaan tii ilaah siiyey ka badan tirana uma baahna qolaan aheyna ogaadeen kuma qarin kartid Ilaahbaa darajo siiyey ee meel hakaga dhicin.

What is written in the book:

Northern Argobba
Northern Argobba people are generally referred to as Argobba. However, there is a clan called Doba Shagura among them, and the Doba are those who established the Walashma dynasty. Even though the Shagura are also called Argobba and speak the Argobba language, it is said that they are a mixed people. Doba does not refer to a language, but to a clan within the Argobba. The Argobba in southern Wollo make a distinction within the Argobba on the basis of race and settlement. They distinguish between Argobba Serte and Argobba Wata. They explain that the Argobba Serte are pure Argobba, while the Argobba Wata are
nomadic and mixed with the Oromo and the Afar.

Southern Argobba
These are the Argobba who live around Harar in Fedis and Bisidemo. Although
they all consider themselves Argobba like their northern brothers, they also make an
internal distinction between Adiya and Ala. Ala are mixed with the Oromo. Outside
this, each village carries the name of the village founder, e.g. Yishaq Umardin, Umar
Kule, etc.

Both Northern and Southern Argobba are Semitic speakers and claim that they have the same religious, cultural and historical origin. They are indeed similar. Nevertheless, it is possible to indicate differences in their present language use. Although the language of the Northern Argobba is influenced by Amharic, Oromigna, and Afarigna, we can observe that it is similar and close to Tigrignya and Guragegna. On the other hand, Southern Argobba has been fully absorbed by Oromigna. Nevertheless, on close examination, there are indications that their ancient language was either very close to Amharic or that they were Amharic speakers. Although the language has disappeared now, women and mothers recall lyrics sung at weddings. They say they learnt those poems from their mothers. It can be said that the poems are Amharic. Although it is established that the Argobba in Harar share the same religion and history as the Northern Argobba, they are now Amharic speakers. They explain that the Argobba Serte are pure Argobba, while the Argobba Wata are nomadic and mixed with the Oromo and the Afar.

So with all due respect give some consideration on what you are posting , to some people it may be quite offensive when you add other tribes who don't belong to them on their tribe.
