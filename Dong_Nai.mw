Đồng Nai (Vietnamese: [ɗə̂wŋm naːj] (About this sound listen)) is a province in the Southeast region of Vietnam, located east and northeast of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The largest city in Đồng Nai is Biên Hòa. Prior to Vietnamese colonization, the area was dominated by the Funan, Chenla, Khmer empire and subsequent influences until 1627. The area was known as Kâmpéâp Srâkatrey (កំពាប់ [កំពប់] ស្រកាត្រី) in Khmer.
