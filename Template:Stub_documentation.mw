This is a '''stub template'''. A brief explanation of these templates follow; for full details please consult [[Wikipedia:Gumud]]. 

===What is a stub?===
A stub is an article containing only a few sentences of text which is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject.

===How is a stub identified?===
*If possible, try to find the most appropriate stub template for the article. A full list can be found at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types]].
*Two or more different stub templates may be used, if necessary, though no more than four should be used on any article.
*Place a stub template ''[[WP:FOOTERS|at the very end]]'' of the article, after the "External links" section, any navigation templates, and the category tags. As usual, templates are added by including their name inside double braces, e.g. <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki>.

===Further information===

*[[Wikipedia:Stub]]

New stub templates and categories (collectively "stub types") should not be created without prior proposal at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals]]. This allows for the proper coordination of all stub types across Wikipedia, and for the checking of any new stub type for possible problems prior to its creation.
