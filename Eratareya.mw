'''Eritrea''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: {{Unicode|ኤርትራ}} {{Unicode|''ʾĒrtrā''}}), is a [[country]] in northern [[East Africa]] bordered by [[Sudan]] in the west, [[Ethiopia]] in the south, and [[Djibouti]] in the southeast. The east and northeast of the country have an extensive coastline on the [[Red Sea]], directly across from [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and several of the [[Hanish Islands]] are part of Eritrea. 

Eritrea was consolidated into a [[colony]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] government on [[January 1]], [[1890]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Historical Dictionary of Eritrea| first=Tom |last=Killion |year=1998 |id=ISBN 0-8108-3437-5}}</ref> The modern state of Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia following a thirty-year [[Eritrean War of Independence|war]] which lasted from 1961 to 1991. Eritrea's constitution adopted in 1997 stipulates that the state is a presidential republic with a [[unicameral]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. The constitution, however, has not yet been implemented fully due to, according to the government, the prevailing border conflict with Ethiopia which began in May of 1998.

Eritrea is a multilingual and multicultural country with two dominant religions ([[Sunni Islam]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Christianity]]) and nine ethnic groups. The country has no official language, but it has three working languages: [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[English language|English]].<ref>"{{PDFlink|[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Eritrea.pdf Country Profile:Eritrea]|128&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 131377 bytes -->}}.

==History==
{{main|History of Eritrea}}
The oldest written source of the territory currently known as Eritrea is the chronicled expedition launched to the fabled ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or "Ta Netjeru," meaning land of the Gods) by the [[Ancient Egyptians]] in the twenty-fifth century&nbsp;BC under [[Pharao]] [[Sahure]]<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Punt#Punt.27s_location</ref>. Later sources from the Pharao [[Hatshepsut]] in the fifteenth century&nbsp;BC present a more detailed portrayal of an expedition in search of incense. The geographical location of the missions to Punt is described as roughly corresponding to the southern west coast of the [[Red Sea]].

The modern name Eritrea was first employed by the Italian colonialists in the late nineteenth century. It is the [[Italian language|Italian]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''Ερυθραία'' (''Erythraîa''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]), which derives from the Greek term for the [[Red Sea]] ({{polytonic|Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα}}). 

===Pre-history===
In 1995, the cranium of a hominid, showing intermediate characters between [[Homo erectus]] and an archaic [[Homo sapiens]], was found in Buya (Eritrean Danakil) by [[Italy|Italian]] scientists. The cranium was dated to over 1 million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abbate, Ernesto; Albianelli, Andrea; Azzaroli, Augusto; Benvenuti, Marco; Tesfamariam, Berhane;

The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exn.ca/hominids/outofafrica.cfm |accessdate=2006-10-02 |title=Out of Africa |date=[[1999-09-10]]}}</ref> [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[mesolithic]] remains in the form of cave paintings in central and northern Eritrea attest to the early settlement of hunter-gatherers in this region. 

A US [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], William Sanders of the University of Michigan, suggests that the fossil of a pig-sized creature found in Eritrea represents the missing link between ancient and modern elephants. Sanders claims that the dating of the fossil to 27 million years ago also pushes the origins of elephants and mastodons five million years further into the past than previously recorded and asserts that modern elephants originated in Africa, in contrast to mammals such as rhinos that had their origins in Europe and Asia and migrated into Africa. In addition to Sanders, the research team included scientists from the University of Asmara in Eritrea; Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA; the Eritrean ministry of mines and energy; Global Resources in Asmara, Eritrea; the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris; the Elephant Research Foundation; the National Museum of Eritrea; and Deutsches Primatenzentrum in Gottingen, Germany.

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of agricultural settlement, urbanism, trade and agriculture is found in the region inhabited by  people dating back to 3500&nbsp;BC in the archaeological sites called the ''Gash group''. Based on the archaeological evidence, there seems to have been a connection between the peoples of the Gash group and the civilizations of the [[Nile Valley]] namely [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]].<ref name="urbanism"/> Ancient Egyptian sources also give references to cities and trading posts along the southwestern Red Sea coast, roughly corresponding to modern day Eritrea, calling this ''the land of [[Land_of_Punt|Punt]]'' famed for its incense. Expeditions to this very land were launched by the Ancient Egyptians as early as the twenty-fifth century&nbsp;BC and were chronicled in detail. 

In the highlands, in one of the capital city [[Asmara]]'s suburbs ''Sembel'' at the mouth of the river [[Anseba]], another site was found from the [[9th century BC|ninth century&nbsp;BC]] of another agricultural and urban settlement which traded both with the [[Sabaeans]] across the Red Sea and with the civilizations of the Nile Valley further west along caravan routes that followed the [[Anseba River]]. Around this time, several cities with a high amount of Sabean remains (inscriptions, artifacts, monuments, architecture etc) seem to emerge in the central highlands and along the central coast including one called ''Saba''. Some are undoubtedly built on top of older sites.

Around the eighth century&nbsp;BC, a kingdom known as [[D'mt]] was established in what is today northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital at [[Yeha]] in northern Ethiopia and which had extensive relations with the [[Sabeans]] in present day [[Yemen]] across the [[Red Sea]].<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity''. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp.57. </ref><ref>Taddesse Tamrat, ''Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270-1527'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp.5-13.</ref><ref>Megalommatis, Mohammed K.P. "[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-4-2005-74197.asp Yemen's Past and Perspectives are in Africa, not a fictitious 'Arab' world]"</ref> After D'mt's decline around the fifth century&nbsp;BC, the state of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] arose in Eritrea and the northern [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. It grew during the fourth century&nbsp;BC and came into prominence during the first century&nbsp;AD, [[Aksumite currency|minting its own coins]] by the third century, converting in the fourth century to Christianity, as the second official Christian state (after Armenia) and the first country to feature the cross on its coins. According to [[Mani]], it grew to be one of the four greatest civilizations in the world, on a par with [[History of China|China]], [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. In the [[7th century AD]]; with the advent of [[Islam]] across the Red Sea in [[Arabia]], Aksum's trade and power on the Red Sea began to decline and the center moved farther inland to the highlands of what is today Ethiopia and the state was eventually defeated by Islamic as well as other internal forces circa 850 or 950&nbsp;AD<ref>Andersen, Knud Tage. "The Queen of the Habasha in Ethiopian History, Tradition, and Chronology" in ''Bulletin of the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London'', vol. 63, no. 1 (2000), pp.31-63.</ref>

===Medieval history===
During the medieval period, contemporary with and following the disintegration of the Axumite Kingdom, several states as well as tribal and clan lands emerged in the area known today as Eritrea. Between the eighth and thirteenth century, northern and western Eritrea had largely come under the domination of the [[Beja]], an Islamic, [[Cushitic]] people from northeastern [[Sudan]]. They formed five independent [[petty kingdoms]] known as: ''Naqis'', ''Baqlin'', ''Bazin'', ''Jarin'' and ''Qata''.<ref>''http://american.edu/ted/ice/eritrea.htm''</ref> The Beja brought Islam to large parts of Eritrea and connected the region to the greater Islamic world dominated by the [[Ummayad]] Caliphate, followed by the [[Abbasid]] (and [[Mamluk]]) and later the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ummayads had taken [[Dahlak Archipelago|Dahlak archipelago]] by 702 although the islands and the coast often changed hands between Arabs and local post-Axumite [[petty kingdoms]] during medeival times until islamic domination was cemented on the coast by the 16th century under the Ottomans.<ref>"Dahlak Archipelago," in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005).</ref>

Medieval times saw a clash of interests in the area where Eritrea currently lies between islamic and native powers which held sway over the western lowlands and coast while the [[Abyssinian]] petty kingdoms which evolved out of the ancient Axum dominated the highlands and hinterland and engaged in mutual rivalry when not warding off the islamic encroachments. The Eritrean highlands and adjacent areas in [[Ethiopia]] and the coast belonged to the petty kingdom of Midri Bahri ("sea land") ruled by the [[Bahr negus]] ("ruler of the sea") whose capital was [[Debarwa]], now a small town 25 Km south of Eritrea's capital [[Asmara]].<ref>"Bur," in ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''.</ref><ref>Daniel Kendie, ''The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict 1941 – 2004: Deciphering the Geo-Political Puzzle'' (United States of America: Signature Book Printing, 2005), pp. 17-8.</ref> Eritreas eastern coastland remained an independent islamic state known as the Kingdom of [[Adal]] until the 16th century when it disintegrated and was divided by Abyssinians demanding tribute in the hinterland and Ottomans doing the same on the coast. 

[[Image:Massawaturkishbuilding.jpg|thumb|Ottoman architecture in Massawa.]]
An Ottoman invading force under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] conquered [[Massawa]] in 1557, building what is now considered the 'old town' of Massawa on Batsi island.  They also conquered the towns of [[Arkiko|Hergigo]], and [[Debarwa]], the capital city of the contemporary [[Bahr negus]] (ruler), [[Bahr negus Yeshaq|Yeshaq]], naming their domain ''Habesh''. Suleiman's forces fought as far south as southeastern [[Tigray province|Tigray]] before being repulsed. Yeshaq was able to retake much of what the Ottomans captured with assistance from fellow Abyssinians, but he later twice revolted with Ottoman support against the then dominant king of Abyssinia and subsequent rival pretendent to the ambiguous position of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. By 1578, all revolts had ended, leaving the Ottomans in control of the important ports of [[Massawa]] and [[Arkiko|Hergigo]] and their environs, and leaving the hinterland domains of [[Habesh]] to [[Beja]] ''Na'ib''s (deputies). The Ottomans maintained their dominion over the northern coastal areas for nearly 300 years. Their possessions were left to their [[Egypt]]ian heirs in 1865 and were taken over by the Italians in 1885.

=== Colonial era ===
[[Image:EPLFrebels.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Members of the [[EPLF]]. Isaias Afwerki, the current president of Eritrea, is second from bottom left.]]
An Italian [[Roman Catholic]] missionary and explorer by the name of ''Giuseppe Sapetto'' purchased the port of [[Asseb]] from a local Afar Sultan on behalf of a [[Genoa|Genovese]] Shipping Company called ''Rubattino'' in 1869. This happened in the same year as the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. In the ongoing [[Scramble for Africa]], Italy as one of the European colonial powers began vying for a possession along the strategic coast of what was to become the world's busiest shipping lane. With the approval of the Italian parliament and King [[Umberto I]] of Italy (later succeeded by his son [[Victor Emmanuel III]]), the government of Italy bought the Rubattino Company's holdings and expanded its possessions northwards along the Red Sea coast towards and beyond Massawa, encroaching on and quickly expelling previously 'Egyptian' possessions. The Italians met with stiffer resistance in the Eritrean highlands from the army of the then dominant Abyssinian King, Ras Kassa of [[Tigray]] who had himself crowned Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia and who also wanted a piece of these lands as an outlet to the sea. Nevertheless the Italians consolidated their possessions into one colony, henceforth known as Eritrea, territory of Italy as of [[New Years Day]] of [[1890]].

The Italians remained the colonial power in Eritrea until they were defeated by Allied forces in [[World War II]] (1941), and Eritrea became a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]]. After the war, the [[United Nations]] conducted a lengthy inquiry, including a failed attempt at conducting a referendum in Eritrea which was resolved by a UN plebiscite in the General Assembly in 1952. The superpowers wrestled for a stake in the Eritrean question. The communist bloc headed by the USSR along with most non-aligned third world countries initially favored the independence of Eritrea, although many African liberation movements did not, out of sympathy for Ethiopia's desire for a seacoast. However, few African countries had achieved independence in the 1950s. The western powers Britain, France and the United States on the other hand already had Imperial Ethiopia as a close ally in line with western interests in the region and favored Eritrea being united with Ethiopia, rather than risk an independent Eritrea becoming an arab-dominated or communist anti-western state. John Foster Dulles, the secretary of state of the United States at the time, said:

''"From the point of view of justice, the opinions of the Eritrean people must receive consideration. Nevertheless, the strategic interests of the United States in the Red Sea Basin and considerations of security and world peace make it necessary that the country (Eritrea) has to be linked with our ally, Ethiopia",'' John Foster Dulles in 1952.

The UN plebiscite voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be [[federation|federated]] with [[Ethiopia]]. Eritrea would have its own [[parliament]] and administration, and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and was now the federal parliament. In 1961 the thirty year[[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]], began after years of peaceful protest against Ethiopian violation of Eritrean democratic rights and autonomy had culminated in the Emperor of Ethiopia [[Haile Selassie I]]'s dissolution of the federation in 1961 followed by shutting down the parliament and declaring Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.

=== Struggle for independence ===
[[Image:Shida_monument.jpg|thumb|left|The sandals worn by the fighters of Independence have become iconic. This monument in Asmara was erected in memoriam.]]
Eritreans formed the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF) and rebelled. The rebel movement was initially dominated by the ELF which was a conservative grass roots movement dominated by [[Muslim]] lowlanders and thus received backing from [[Arab]] socialist governments such as Syria and Egypt. Internal divisions based on religion, ethnicity, clan and sometimes just in personalities and ideologies led to the weakening and factioning of the ELF from which sprung
the EPLF which professed [[Marxism]] and egalitarian values devoid of gender, religion or ethnic bias. It came to be supported by a growing Eritrean Diaspora. Bitter fighting broke out between the ELF and EPLF during the 1970s and 1980s for dominance over Eritrea. The ELF continued to dominate the Eritrean landscape well into the 1970s when the struggle for independence neared victory due to Ethiopia's ongoing socialist revolution against the monarchy. The ELF's gains suffered when Ethiopia was overtaken by the [[Derg]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] military junta with backing from the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Nevertheless, Eritrean resistance continued and the numbers of the EPLF swelled as did that of Ethiopian resistance movements with which the EPLF struck alliances to overthrow the communist Ethiopian regime. The US and the Saudis, concerned at the presence of an avowedly Marxist state in Ethiopia encouraged and supported Eritrean independence as a means of neutralising the regime in Addis Ababa.

=== Independence ===
[[Image:Er-map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Eritrea]]
The struggle for independence ended in 1991 with the EPLF expelling the Ethiopian Army from Eritrea and joining forces with Ethiopian resistance movements to overthrow the Derg regime, which fell the same year. Two years later, a [[referendum]] was held supervised by the UN mission UNOVER, with universal suffrage and conducted both in and outside Eritrea (among Eritrean communities in the diaspora), on whether Eritreans wanted independence or unity with Ethiopia. Over 99% of the Eritrean people voted for independence which was declared on May 24 1993. The leader of the EPLF, [[Isaias Afewerki]], became Eritrea's first Provisional [[President]], and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (later renamed the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]], or PFDJ) created a government.

In 1998, [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|a border war]] with [[Ethiopia]] over the town of [[Badme]] occurred. The [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] ended in 2000 with a negotiated agreement known as the [[Algiers Agreement]], which assigned an independent, UN-associated boundary commission known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries. The EEBC issued a final border ruling in April 2002 and awarded [[Badme]] to Eritrea. However, Ethiopia still refuses to implement the ruling it had signed, resulting in regional instability.

==Regions and districts==
{{main|Regions of Eritrea|Districts of Eritrea}}
[[Image:Eritrea regions numbered.png|thumb|[[Regions of Eritrea]]]]
Eritrea is divided into 6 [[Regions of Eritrea|regions]] (''zobas'') and subdivided into [[Districts of Eritrea|districts]] ("sub-zobas"). The geographical extent of the regions is based on their respective hydrological properties. This is due to a dual intent on the part of the Eritrean government, to provide each administration with sufficient control over its agricultural capacity and eliminate historical intra-regional conflicts. 

The regions, followed by the sub-region, are:

== Politics and government==
[[Image:Afwerki.jpg‎ |thumb|300px|Eritrean President [[Isaias Afewerki]]{{unverifiedimage}}]]
{{main|Politics of Eritrea}}
The National Assembly of 150 seats, formed in 1993 shortly after independence, elected the current president, [[Isaias Afewerki]].  National elections have been periodically scheduled and canceled.  Independent local sources of political information on Eritrean domestic politics are scarce; in September 2001 the government closed down all of the nation's privately owned print [[News media|media]], and outspoken critics of the government have been arrested and held without trial, according to various international observers, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]].  In 2004 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] declared Eritrea a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) for its alleged record of religious [[persecution]] (see below). 

===National elections===
Eritrean National elections were set for 1997 and then postponed until 2001; it was then decided that because 20% of Eritrea's land was under occupation that elections would be postponed until the resolution of the conflict with Ethiopia.  However, local elections have continued in Eritrea. The most recent round of local government elections were held in May 2004. On further elections, the President's Chief of Staff, Yemane Ghebremeskel said,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shaebia.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=9&num=2618&printer=1 |title=Interview of Mr. Yemane Gebremeskel, Director of the Office of the President of Eritrea |publisher=PFDJ |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> 
{{cquote|The electoral commission is handling these elections this time round so that may be the new element in this process. The national assembly has also mandated the electoral commission to set the date for national elections, so whenever the electoral commission sets the date there will be national elections. It's not dependent on regional elections, although that might be a very helpful process.
 
Multipartyism, in general principle yes, it is there but the law on political parties has to be approved by the national assembly. It was not approved the last time. The view from the beginning was that you don't necessarily need a party law to hold national elections. You can have national elections and the party law can be adopted at any time. So in terms of commitment it's very clear, in terms of the process it has its own pace, its own characteristics.}}

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Eritrea}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
Eritrea is a member in good standing of the African Union (AU), the successor of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). But it has withdrawn its representative to the AU in protest of the AU's lack of leadership in facilitating the implementation of a binding border decision demarcating the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea's relationship with the United States is complicated. Although the two nations have a close working relationship regarding the on-going war on terror, there has been a growing tension in other areas. Eritrea's relationship with Italy and the EU has become equally strained in many areas in the last three years. 

Within the region, Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia turned from that of close alliance to a deadly rivalry that led to a war from May, 1998 to June 2000 in which 19,000 Eritreans were killed. 

External issues include an undemarcated border with [[Sudan]], a war with [[Yemen]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1996, and a recent border conflict with [[Ethiopia]]. 

The undemarcated border with Sudan poses a problem for Eritrean external relations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3400575.stm |title=Eritrea-Sudan relations plummet |publisher=BBC |date=2004-01-15 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> After a high-level delegation to Sudan from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ties are being normalized. Meanwhile, Eritrea has been recognized as a broker for peace between the separate factions of the Sudanese civil war. "It is known that Eritrea played a role in bringing about the peace agreement [between the Southern Sudanese and Government],"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=12393 |title=Turabi terms USA "world's ignoramuses", fears Sudan's partition |publisher=Sudan Tribune |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> while the Sudanese Government and Eastern Front rebels have requested Eritrea to mediate peace talks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=15117 |title=Sudan demands Eritrean mediation with eastern Sudan rebels |publisher=Sudan Tribune 
|date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

A dispute with [[Yemen]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1996 resulted in a brief war. As part of an agreement to cease hostilities the two nations agreed to refer the issue to the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] at [[the Hague]]. At the conclusion of the proceedings, both nations acquiesced to the decision. Since 1996 both governments have remained wary of one another but relations are relatively normal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/192667.stm |title=Flights back on between Yemen and Eritrea |publisher=BBC |date=1998-12-13 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> 

The undemarcated border with Ethiopia is the primary external issue facing Eritrea. This  led to a long and bloody border war between 1998 and 2000. As a result, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea ([[UNMEE]]) is occupying a 25&nbsp;kilometers by 900&nbsp;kilometers area on the border to help stabilize the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4041073.stm |title=Q&A: Horn's bitter border war |publisher=BBC |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war.<ref name="horntension1">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3457957.stm |title=Horn tensions trigger UN warning |publisher=BBC |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4400580.stm |title=Army build-up near Horn frontier |publisher=BBC |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref name="horntension3">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4555892.stm |title=Horn border tense before deadline |publisher=BBC |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> Central to the continuation of the stalemate is Ethiopia's failure to abide by the border delimitation ruling and reneging on its commitment to demarcation. The stalemate has led the President of Eritrea to urge the UN to take action on Ethiopia. This request is outlined in the [[Wikisource:Eleven Letters|Eleven Letters]] penned by the President to the United Nations Security Council. The situation is further escalated by the continued effort of the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders in supporting each other's opposition.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Eritrea sunset.jpg|thumb|left|A view from the Keren-Asmara Highway.]]
{{main|Geography of Eritrea}}
Eritrea is located in East Africa, more specifically the [[Horn of Africa]], and is bordered on the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]]. The country is virtually bisected by one of the world's longest mountain ranges, the [[Great Rift Valley]], with fertile lands to the west and the descent to desert in the East. Off the sandy and arid coastline is situated the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds. The land to the south, in the highlands, is slightly drier and cooler. Eritrea at the southern end of the Red Sea is the home of the fork in the rift. 

The [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another: the Arabian Plate, and the two parts of the African Plate (the Nubian and the Somalian) splitting along the East African Rift Zone (USGS). The highest point of the country, [[Amba Soira]], is located in the centre of Eritrea, at 3,018&nbsp;metres (9,902&nbsp;ft) above sea level. In 2006, Eritrea announced it would become the first country in the world to turn its entire coast into an environmentally protected zone. The 837-mile coastline, along with another 1,209-miles of coast around its more than 350 islands, will come under governmental protection.

The main cities of the country are the capital city of [[Asmara]] and the port town of [[Asseb]] in the southeast, as well as the towns of [[Massawa]] to the east, and [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] to the north.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Eritrea}}
{{seealso|Eritrean Railway|Transport in Eritrea}}
Like the economies of many other [[Africa]]n nations, the economy is largely based on subsistence [[agriculture]], with 80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The only natural disaster that sometimes affects Eritrea, drought, has often created trouble in the farming areas.&nbsp;[http://www.encapafrica.org/documents/PEA_pestmanagement/ERITREA_LG_SEA_MAR93.doc] 

The [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] severely hurt Eritrea's economy. [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth in 1999 fell to less than 1%, and GDP decreased by 8.2% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into southern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss, including losses of $225 million in [[livestock]] and 55,000 homes. The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region, causing food production to drop by over 60%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/er.html#Econ |title=Economy - overview |publisher=CIA |date=2006-06-6 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1184714.stm |title=Aid sought for Eritrean recovery |publisher=BBC |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

Even during the war, Eritrea developed its transportation [[infrastructure]], asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges as a part of the [[Wefri Warsay Yika'alo|Warsay Yika'alo Program]]. The most significant of these projects has been the building of a coastal highway of more than 500&nbsp;km connecting [[Massawa]] with [[Asseb]] as well as the rehabilitation of the [[Eritrean Railway]]. The rail line now runs between the Port of Massawa and the capital Asmara.

Eritrea's economic future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole to fill. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master fundamental social problems like [[illiteracy]], and low skills.

== Society ==
=== Demographics ===
[[Image:Eritrea-people-map.gif|thumb|A map indicating the ethnic composition of Eritrea.]]
{{main|Demographics of Eritrea}}
Eritrean society is ethnically heterogeneous. Independent census has yet to be conducted but the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya]] and the [[Tigre people]] together make up about 45.0%.  The rest of the population is comprised of the smaller populations of the [[Saho people|Saho]], [[Nara people|Nara]], [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]], [[Beja people|Beja]], [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Bilen people|Bilen]], [[Kunama people|Kunama]], and the [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]]. Each nationality speaks a different native tongue, but typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language. The [[Jeberti]]s are [[Muslim]] Tigrinyas who consider themselves a separate ethnicity, however, in Eritrea ethnicity is determined by language and so they are not officially recognized as separate from the Tigrinya.

There exist minorities of [[Italians]] and Ethiopian Tigrayans. Neither is generally given citizenship unless through marriage or having it conferred upon them by the State. 

The most recent addition to the nationalities of Eritrea is the [[Rashaida]]. The Rashaida came to Eritrea in the nineteenth century<ref>{{cite web |last=Alders |first=Anne |url=http://www.eritreanbeauty.com/r.html |title=the Rashaida |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> from the Arabian Coast. The Rashaida do not typically intermarry, are typically nomadic, and number approximately 61,000, less than 1% of the population. 

The Kunama are one of the earliest settled peoples in Eritrea. They adopted rain-fed agriculture and settled into communal villages in the 'lowlands' of Eritrea.

Between 900 and 500&nbsp;BC Eritrea experienced massive migrations and cultural contacts from Saba in Southern Arabia. The Sabean area in Eritrea is mainly to be found in the Kebessa highlands surrounding the capital Asmara and extending southwards. There the Sabeans found the same geographical conditions as in their native Saba, suitable to terracing and their pre-existing agricultural modes of production.

===Languages===
[[Image:Rashaida_family.png|thumb|Rashaida children in the Eritrean lowlands.]]
{{main|Languages of Eritrea}}
Many languages are spoken in Eritrea today. The two language families that most of the languages stem from are the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] families. The Semitic languages in Eritrea are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (spoken natively by the [[Rashaida]] Arabs), [[Tigre language|Tigre]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and the newly recognized [[Dahlik language|Dahlik]]; these languages (primarily Tigre and Tigrinya) are spoken as a first language by over 80% of the population. The Cushitic languages in Eritrea are just as numerous, including [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Blin language|Blin]], and [[Saho language|Saho]]. [[Kunama language|Kunama]] and [[Nara language|Nara]] are also spoken in Eritrea and belong to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language family]]. [[English language|English]] is spoken to a degree by more educated Eritreans, and there are still some speakers of [[Italian language|Italian]] leftover from colonial times. 

The local Tigrinya and the wider Arabic language are the two predominant languages for official purposes, but a few Italian speakers can still be found. Along with Arabic (spoken natively only by the Rashaida), English is the most widely spoken non-African language.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Eritrea}}
There are five levels of education in Eritrea, pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary and post-secondary. There are nearly 238,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools<ref>{{cite book |year=2005 |title=Baseline Study on Livelihood Systems in Eritrea |publisher=National Food Information System of Eritrea}}</ref> in Eritrea and two Universities (University of Asmara and the Institute of Science and Technology) as well as several smaller colleges and technical schools. 

One of the most important goals of Eritrea's educational policy is to provide basic education in each of Eritrea's mother tongues, as well as to develop a self-motivated and conscientious population to fight poverty and disease. Furthermore it is tooled to produce a society that is equipped with the necessary skills to function with a culture of self-reliance in the modern economy. 

The education system in Eritrea is also designed to promote [[private sector]] schooling, equal access for all groups (''i.e.'', prevent [[gender discrimination]], prevent [[ethnic discrimination]], prevent class discrimination, etc.) and promote continuing education, both formally and informally. 

Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional [[taboos]], school fees (for registration and materials), and the [[opportunity costs]] of [[low-income]] households.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kifle |first=Temesgen |year=2002 |title=Educational Gender Gap in Eritrea}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[Image:Churchesndmosque_eritrea.jpg|thumb|right|Enda Mariam Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Cathedral, Al Khulafa Al Rashiudin  Mosque (in the foreground, rear left, and rear right respectively) in the capital [[Asmara]].]]
Eritrea has two dominant religions, [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].  Muslims,  who make up about 50% of the population predominantly follow [[Sunni Islam]]. The Christians (about 50%) consist primarily of the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church]], which is the local [[Oriental Orthodox]] church, but small groups of [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Protestant]]s, and other denominations also exist. 

Members of the Eritrean Orthodox Church are sometimes described as [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Christians]] because it was formerly part of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], which was until 1959 subject to the Coptic Pope. However, the word ''Coptic'' in modern usage refers primarily to the [[Coptic Christian|Egyptian Orthodox]] jurisdiction of [[Oriental Orthodox]] Christianity. The Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox churches are still in [[full communion]] with the Coptic Church in Egypt. The Eritrean Orthodox Church was granted [[autocephaly]] in 1993 by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church when Eritrea became independent, and, in 1998 the Archbishop of [[Asmara]], the capital, was elevated to the rank of patriarchate. 

Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has only officially recognized the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]], [[Sunni Islam]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and the Evangelical [[Lutheran]] church. All other faiths and denominations were required to undergo a registration process that was so stringent as to effectively be prohibitive. Amongst other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership in order to be allowed to [[worship]]. The few organisations that have met all of the registration requirements have still not received official recognition. Other faith groups like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Bahá'í faith]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and numerous Protestant denominations are not registered and cannot worship freely. They have effectively been banned, and harsh measures have been taken against their adherents. Over twenty Protestant pastors and almost 2000 church members have so far been imprisoned indefinitely. In addition several Orthodox priests have also been imprisoned [http://www.persecution.com.au/news/article.asp?artid=3B41C8CA-C1AC-4529-8AD3-DC11FCC09D1B&c=9 33], and the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church has been replaced by the Eritrean Orthodox Synod and placed under stringent house arrest ostensibly for objecting to government interference in church affairs.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

There is also one last native Jew left in Eritrea, formerly from a community of hundreds in Asmara, whose ancestors had crossed from Aden in the late nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4955088.stm |title=Asmara's last Jew recalls 'good old days' |publisher=BBC |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3246419,00.html |title=Eritrea's last native Jew tends graves, remembers |publisher=Y Net News |date=2006-05-02 |accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

== Culture ==
[[Image:kitcha_fit_fit.png|thumb|Eritrea's cuisine is very rich. Here, the typical ''Kitcha fit-fit'' is presented with a scoop of fresh yogurt and topped with berbere (spice).]]
{{main|Culture of Eritrea}}
{{seealso|Cuisine of Eritrea|Literature of Eritrea|Music of Eritrea}}
The Eritrean region has traditionally been a nexus for [[trade]] throughout the world. Because of this, the influence of diverse [[cultures]] can be seen throughout Eritrea. Today, the most obvious influences in the capital, Asmara, are that of Italy. Throughout Asmara, there are small cafes serving beverages common to Italy. In Asmara, there is a clear merging of the Italian colonial influence with the traditional Tigrinya lifestyle. In the villages of Eritrea, these changes never took hold. 

In the cities, before the Occupation and during the early years, the import of [[Bollywood]] films was commonplace, while Italian and American films were available in the cinemas as well. In the 1980s and since Independence, however, American films have certainly become the most common. Vying for market share are films by local producers, who have slowly come into their own. The global broadcast of Eri-TV has brought cultural images to the large Eritrean population in the Diaspora who frequents the country every summer. 

[[Image:Kunama_Eritrea.JPG|thumb|left|A traditional [[Kunama]] herder posing for a picture near Barentu, Zoba Gash-Barka.]]
Traditional Eritrean dress is quite varied with the Kunama traditionally dressing in brightly colored clothes while the Tigrinya and Tigre traditionally dress in bright white costumes, resembling traditional Oriental and Indian clothing. The Rashaida women are ornately bejeweled and scarfed. 

Popular sports in Eritrea are [[football (soccer)|football]] and bicycle racing. Eritrea is not a strong football power, however, owing to its existing infrastructure and talent.

Almost unique on the African continent, the [[Tour of Eritrea]] is a bicycle race from the hot desert beaches of Massawa, up the winding mountain highway with its precipitous valleys and cliffs to the capital Asmara. From there, it continues downwards onto the western plains of the Gash-Barka Zone, only to return back to Asmara from the south. This is, by far, the most popular sport in Eritrea, though, as of late long-distance running has garnered its own supporters. The momentum for long-distance running in Eritrea can be seen in the successes of [[Zersenay Tadesse]] and [[Mebrahtom Keflezighi|Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi]], both Olympians.
