The '''Organisation of Islamic Cooperation''' ('''OIC'''; {{lang-ar|منظمة التعاون الإسلامي|Munaẓẓama at-Taʿāwun al-ʾIslāmiyy}}; {{lang-fr|Organisation de la coopération islamique}}), formerly the '''Organisation of the Islamic Conference''', is an international organization founded in 1969, consisting of [[Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|57 member states]], with a collective population of over 1.8 billion as of 2015 with 49 countries being Muslim-majority countries.<ref>[[Pew Forum|The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]].

The OIC has permanent delegations to the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]]. The official languages of the OIC are Arabic, English, and French.

== History ==
On 21 August 1969 a fire was started in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem.  [[Amin al-Husseini]], the former Mufti of Jerusalem, called the arson a "Jewish crime" and called for all Muslim heads of state to convene a summit.<ref name="ECSWWII">{{cite book|editor1-last=Ciment|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Hill|editor2-first=Kenneth|title=Encyclopedia of Conflicts Since World War II, Volume 1|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge.|pages=185–6|isbn=9781136596148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uox4CAAAQBAJ&q=oic+1969+fire+jerusalem&pg=PA185|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref> The fire, which "destroyed part of the old wooden roof and a 800-year-old pulpit"<ref name="LIEBER-2017">{{cite web|last1=LIEBER|first1=DOV|title=PA, Hamas [allege] Jews planned 1969 burning of Al-Aqsa Mosque|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/pa-hamas-rehash-lie-that-jews-planned-1969-burning-of-al-aqsa-mosque/|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=17 November 2017|date=22 August 2017}}</ref> was blamed on the mental illness of the perpetrator – Australian Christian fundamentalist [[Denis Michael Rohan]] — by Israel, and on [[Denis Michael Rohan#Arab.2FMuslim reactions|Zionists and Zionism]] in general by the Islamic conference.<ref name="elibrary">{{cite web|title=The organization 'Islamic Conference' (OIC)|url=http://ebrary.net/1069/economics/organization_islamic_conference|website=elibrary|access-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103234029/http://ebrary.net/1069/economics/organization_islamic_conference|archive-date=3 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 25 September 1969, an Islamic Conference, a summit of representatives of 24 Muslim majority countries (most of the representatives being heads of state), was held in [[Rabat]], Morocco.<ref name="ECSWWII" /><ref name="EIMW" /> A resolution was passed stating that<blockquote>"Muslim government would consult with a view to promoting among themselves close cooperation and mutual assistance in the economic, scientific, cultural and spiritual fields, inspired by the immortal teachings of Islam."<ref name="ECSWWII" /></blockquote>Six months later in March 1970, the First Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers was held in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia.<ref name="elibrary" /> In 1972, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) was founded.<ref name="esposito-1998-164">Esposito, 1998, p.164.</ref>

While the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|al-Aqsa]] fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the OIC, many [[Muslims]] have aspired to a pan-Islamic institution that would serve the common political, economic, and social interests of the ''[[ummah]]'' (Muslim community) since the 19th century. In particular, the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Caliphate]] after [[World War I]] left a vacuum.

According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.<ref name="EIMW" />

The emblem of the OIC contains three main elements that reflect its vision and mission as incorporated in its new Charter. These elements are: the [[Kaaba]], the Globe, and the Crescent.

On 5 August 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.<ref name="CDHRII">{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, 5 August 1990, U.N.

A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993) [English translation]|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=5 August 1990|access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref>

In March 2008, the OIC conducted a formal revision of its charter.  The revised charter set out to promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, and good governance in all member states. The revisions also removed any mention of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam.  Within the revised charter, the OIC has chosen to support the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and international law, without mentioning the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|title=OIC Charter|url=http://www.oicun.org/2/24/20140324031549266.html|access-date=8 December 2015|location=Ch 1, Art 1, Sect 7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911151816/http://www.oicun.org/2/24/20140324031549266.html|archive-date=11 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 28 June 2011 during the 38th Council of Foreign Ministers meeting (CFM) in Astana, Kazakhstan, the organisation changed its name from '''Organisation of the Islamic Conference''' ({{lang-ar|منظمة المؤتمر الإسلامي}}; {{lang-fr|Organisation de la Conférence Islamique}}) to its current name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=100388|title=OIC RIGHTLY CHANGES ITS NAME|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023092323/http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=100388|archive-date=23 October 2014|newspaper=[[Pakistan Observer]]}}</ref> The OIC also changed its logo at this time.{{Cn|date=May 2021}}

In December 2020 a coalition of American Muslim groups criticized the Organization of Islamic Cooperation for failing to speak up to prevent the [[Uyghur genocide|abuse of the Uyghurs]] and accused member states of being influenced by Chinese power. The groups included the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]].<ref>{{cite web|first1=AFP|title=US Muslim groups accuse OIC of abetting China's Uighur 'genocide'|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/18/us-muslims-press-organization-of-islamic-cooperation-on-china|website=www.aljazeera.com|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref>

=== Refugees ===
According to the [[UNHCR]], OIC countries hosted 18 million refugees by the end of 2010. Since then OIC members have absorbed refugees from other conflicts, including [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|the uprising in Syria]]. In May 2012, the OIC addressed these concerns at the "Refugees in the Muslim World" conference in [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmenistan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=OIC to hold conference on refugees in Muslim world in Turkmenistan|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-278419-oic-to-hold-conference-on-refugees-in-muslim-world-in-turkmenistan.html|work=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]|date=24 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503181729/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-278419-oic-to-hold-conference-on-refugees-in-muslim-world-in-turkmenistan.html|archive-date=3 May 2012}}</ref>

== Member states ==
{{main|Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation}}{{Supranational Islamic Bodies|align=right|size=400px}}

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has 57 members, 56 of which are also [[member states of the United Nations]], the exception being [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. Some members, especially in West Africa and South America, are – though with large Muslim populations – not necessarily [[Muslim majority countries]]. A few countries with significant Muslim populations, such as [[Russia]] and [[Thailand]], sit as Observer States.

The collective [[List of OIC countries by population|population of OIC member states]] is over 1.9 billion as of 2018.

Pakistan has cited [[Kashmir conflict|its conflict with India over the Kashmir region]] as the reason for its opposition, and frequently accuses India of perpetrating widespread [[Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir|human rights abuses against Kashmiris]] in the Indian-administered territory of [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], which has witnessed an [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|ongoing militant uprising]] since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orakzai|first=S.|year=2010|title=Organisation of The Islamic Conference and Conflict Resolution: Case Study of the Kashmir Dispute.

Despite these issues, the first OIC summit held in 1969 in [[Rabat]] did not address the Kashmir dispute, and granting India membership in the organization was discussed nonetheless. The head of the Indian delegation, the then ambassador to [[Morocco]], also addressed the gathering at the summit. The erstwhile [[President of Pakistan]], [[Yahya Khan]], reportedly expressed mixed views towards the induction of India into the OIC as a full member. The Indian delegation, led by the then [[President of India|Indian President]] [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed|Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad]], was scheduled to arrive at the summit but ultimately was not allowed in due to threats by Pakistan to boycott the event, leading to controversy. Differences between the two states led Pakistan to keep India out for the final session of the 1969 conference and all OIC summits thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.khaleejtimes.com/editorials-columns/why-not-india-in-oic|title=Why not India in OIC|work=Kjaleej Times|date=10 October 2009|access-date=1 March 2019|first=Abdulaziz|last=Sager}}</ref>

Indian Foreign Minister Swaraj served as the head for the Indian delegation and attended the summit.

On 18 April 2020, the OIC had issued a statement, urging the [[Premiership of Narendra Modi|Modi administration]] of India to take urgent steps to "stop the growing tide of [[Islamophobia]]", citing attacks by [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] against Indian Muslims and the allegation against Muslims of spreading [[COVID-19]] in the country (see [[violence against Muslims in India]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Arabs are speaking out against Islamophobia in India|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/arabs-speaking-islamophobia-india-200423112102197.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=30 April 2020}}</ref>

=== Cartoons of Muhammad ===
{{main|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}Cartoons of Muhammad, published in a Danish newspaper in September 2005, were found offensive by a number of Muslims. [[Third Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference]] in December 2005 condemned publication of the cartoons, resulting in broader coverage of the issue by news media in Muslim countries. Subsequently, violent demonstrations throughout the Islamic world resulted in several deaths.<ref>{{cite news|title=How a meeting of leaders in Mecca set off the cartoon wars around the world|work=The Independent|date=10 February 2006|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article344482.ece|location=London|first1=Daniel|last1=Howden|first2=David|last2=Hardaker|first3=Stephen|last3=Castle|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708204534/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article344482.ece|archive-date=8 July 2008}}</ref>

=== Human rights ===
OIC created the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]].<ref name="CDHRII" /> While proponents claim it is not an alternative to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]], but rather complementary to it, Article 24 states that "all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Shari'ah" and Article 25 follows with "the Islamic Shari'ah is the only source of reference for the explanation or clarification of any of the articles of this Declaration." Attempts to have it adopted by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] have met increasing criticism, because of its contradiction of the UDHR, including from liberal Muslim groups.<ref>[http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/16/1unupdate.pdf?rd=1 "Human Rights Brief" United Nations Update] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325023127/https://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/16/1unupdate.pdf?rd=1|date=25 March 2009}} Accessed 10 March 2009.</ref> Critics of the CDHR state bluntly that it is "manipulation and hypocrisy," "designed to dilute, if not altogether eliminate, civil and political rights protected by international law" and attempts to "circumvent these principles [of freedom and equality]."<ref>Fatema Mernissi: ''Islam and Democracy'', Cambridge 2002, Perseus Books, p. 67.</ref><ref>Ann Mayer, "An Assessment of Human Rights Schemes," in ''Islam and Human Rights'', p. 175.

[[Human Rights Watch]] says that OIC has "fought doggedly" and successfully within the United Nations Human Rights Council to shield states from criticism, except when it comes to [[criticism of Israel]]. For example, when independent experts reported violations of human rights in the [[2006 Lebanon War]], "state after state from the OIC took the floor to denounce the experts for daring to look beyond Israeli violations to discuss [[Hezbollah]]'s as well." OIC demands that the council "should work cooperatively with abusive governments rather than condemn them." HRW responds that this works with those who are willing to cooperate; others exploit the passivity.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/02/how-put-un-rights-council-back-track How to Put U.N.

The OIC has been criticised for failing to discuss the treatment of ethnic minorities within member countries, such as the oppression of the [[Kurds in Syria]] and [[Kurds in Turkey|Turkey]], the [[Ahwaz]] in [[Iran]], the [[Hazaras]] in [[Afghanistan]], the '[[Al-Akhdam]]' in [[Yemen]], or the [[Berbers]] in [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/multiculturalody00kyml_1|url-access=registration|title=Multicultural Odysseys: Navigating the New International Politics of Diversity|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-928040-7|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/multiculturalody00kyml_1/page/308 308]|first=Will|last=Kymlicka|access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref>

Along with the revisions of the OIC's charter in 2008, the member states created the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission (IPHRC). The IPHRC is an advisory body, independent from the OIC, composed of eighteen individuals from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds. The IPHRC has the power to monitor human rights within the member states and facilitates the integration of human rights into all OIC mandates.  The IPHRC also aids in the promotion of political, civil, and economic rights in all member states.<ref>{{cite journal|last=CISMAS|first=I.|year=2011|title=Statute of the OIC independent permanent human rights commission, introductory note.

==== LGBT rights ====
{{main|LGBT rights at the United Nations}}{{see also|LGBT in Islam}}In March 2012, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] held its first discussion of [[discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]] and gender identity, following the 2011 passage of a resolution supporting LGBT rights proposed by the Republic of South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/PanelDiscussionsHRC19.pdf|title=List of Panel Discussions to take place during 19th session}}</ref> Pakistan's representative addressed the session on behalf of the OIC, denouncing the discussion and questioning the concept of sexual orientation, which he said was being used to promote "licentious behaviour&nbsp;... against the fundamental teachings of various religions, including Islam".

=== Science and technology ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held its [[OIC Science and Technology Summit|first science and technology summit]] at the level of head of state and government in Astana, Republic of Kazakhstan, on 10–11 September 2017.

==== Astana Declaration ====
The Astana Declaration is a policy guidance adopted by OIC members at the Astana Summit. The Astana Declaration commits members to increase investment in science and technology, education, eradicate extreme poverty, and implement UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]].<ref name="oicdeclaration">{{cite web|title=ASTANA DECLARATION|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/docdown/?docID=1604&refID=1067|publisher=OIC|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916052837/http://www.oic-oci.org/docdown/?docID=1604&refID=1067|archive-date=16 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Non-state terrorism ===
In 1999, OIC adopted the OIC Convention on Combatting International Terrorism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oicun.org/articles/55/1/OIC-Convention-on-Combating-International-Terrorism/1.html|title=OIC Convention on Combating International Terrorism|publisher=OICUN|access-date=25 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718212122/http://www.oicun.org/articles/55/1/OIC-Convention-on-Combating-International-Terrorism/1.html|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Human Rights Watch has noted that the definition of terrorism in article 1 describes "any act or threat of violence carried out with the aim of, among other things, imperiling people’s honour, occupying or seizing public or private property, or threatening the stability, territorial integrity, political unity or sovereignty of a state." HRW views this as vague, ill-defined and including much that is outside the generally accepted understandings of the concept of terrorism. In HRW's view, it labels, or could easily be used to label, as terrorist actions, acts of peaceful expression, association, and assembly.<ref name="terrorism">[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/03/10/letter-secretary-general-organisation-islamic-conference Organisation of the Islamic Conference: Improve and Strengthen the 1999 OIC Convention on Combating International Terrorism] Human Rights Watch 11 March 2008.</ref>

Legal scholar [[Ben Saul]] of [[University of Sydney]] argues that the definition is subjective and ambiguous and concludes that there is "serious danger of the abusive use of terrorist prosecutions against political opponents" and others.<ref>Ben Saul: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292164 Branding Enemies: Regional Legal Responses to Terrorism in Asia] ‘'Asia-Pacific Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law, 2008'’ Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper No. 08/127, October 2008.</ref>

Furthermore, HRW is concerned by OIC's apparent unwillingness to recognise as terrorism acts that serve causes endorsed by their member states. Article 2 reads: "Peoples' struggle including armed struggle against foreign occupation, aggression, colonialism, and hegemony, aimed at liberation and self-determination." HRW has suggested to OIC that they embrace "longstanding and universally recognised international human rights standards",<ref name="terrorism" /> a request that has as yet not led to any results.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Contradictions between OIC's and other UN members' understanding of terrorism has stymied efforts at the UN to produce a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.<ref>Patrick Goodenough: [http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=34958 UN Anti-Terror Effort Bogged Down Over Terrorism Definition] CNSNew, 2 September 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207195652/http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=34958|date=7 December 2008}}</ref>

During a meeting in Malaysia in April 2002, delegates discussed terrorism but failed to reach a definition of it. They rejected, however, any description of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Palestinian fight with Israel]] as terrorism. Their declaration was explicit: "We reject any attempt to link terrorism to the struggle of the Palestinian people in the exercise of their inalienable right to establish their independent state with Al-Quds Al-Shrif ([[Jerusalem]]) as its capital." In fact, at the outset of the meeting, the OIC countries signed a statement praising the Palestinians and their "blessed [[wikt:intifada|intifada]]." The word terrorism was restricted to describe Israel, whom they condemned for "[[state terrorism]]" in their war with the Palestinian people.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20020409a1.html The OIC's blind eye to terror] ''The Japan Times'' 9 April 2002. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

At the 34th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM), an OIC section, in May 2007, the foreign ministers termed [[Islamophobia]] "the worst form of terrorism".<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&section=0&article=96276&d=17&m=5&y=2007 ‘Islamophobia Worst Form of Terrorism’] ''Arab News'' 17 May 2007.</ref>

=== Dispute with Thailand ===
[[Thailand]] has responded to OIC criticism of human rights abuses in the [[Islam in Thailand|Muslim majority]] provinces of [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] in the south of the country. In a statement issued on 18 October 2005, secretary-general Ihsanoglu vocalised concern over the continuing conflict in the south that "claimed the lives of innocent people and forced the migration of local people out of their places".<ref name="patanipost.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/090418OIC.html|title=Ihsanoglu urges OIC Member States to accord greater attention to Muslim minority issues|publisher=Patanipost.com|access-date=25 March 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715051741/http://www.patanipost.com/090418OIC.html|archive-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> He also stressed that the Thai government's security approach to the crisis would aggravate the situation and lead to continued violence.

On 18–19 April 2009, the exiled Patani leader [[Abu Yasir Fikri]] (see [[Patani United Liberation Organisation]]) was invited to the OIC to speak about the conflict and present a solution to end the violence between the Thai government and the ethnically Malay Muslims living in the socioeconomically neglected south, that has been struggling against Thai assimilation policy and for self governance since it became annexed by Thailand in 1902. Fikri presented a six-point solution at the conference in Jiddah that included obtaining the same basic rights as other groups when it came to right of language, religion, and culture. He also suggested that Thailand give up its discriminatory policies against the Patani people and allow Patani to at least be allowed the same self-governing rights as other regions in Thailand already have, citing that this does not go against the Thai constitution since it has been done in other parts of Thailand and that it is a matter of political will.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/OIC090419.html|title=Welcome to Patani Post!

He added Thai policies of not investigating corruption, murder, and human rights violations perpetrated by Bangkok-led administration and military personnel against the Malay Muslim population was an obstacle for achieving peace and healing the deep wounds of being treated as third-class citizens.<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="amnesty.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/thailand|title=Thailand|publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref>

Thailand responded to this criticism over its policies. The [[Thailand|Thai]] [[foreign minister]], [[Kantathi Suphamongkhon]], said: "We have made it clear to the OIC several times that the violence in the deep South is not caused by religious conflict and the government grants protection to all of our citizens no matter what religion they embrace." The Foreign Ministry issued a statement dismissing the OIC's criticism and accusing it of disseminating misperceptions and misinformation about the situation in the southern provinces. "If the OIC secretariat really wants to promote the cause of peace and harmony in the three southern provinces of Thailand, the responsibility falls on the OIC secretariat to strongly condemn the militants, who are perpetrating these acts of violence against both Thai Muslims and Thai Buddhists."<ref name="patanipost.com" /><ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-10/20/article08.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823154242/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-10/20/article08.shtml|date=23 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/OicResolution.html|title=OIC Resolution|work=Patani Post|access-date=25 March 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715051807/http://www.patanipost.com/OicResolution.html|archive-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> HRW<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/thailand|title=Thailand|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref> and Amnesty International<ref name="amnesty.org" /> have echoed the same concerns as OIC, rebuffing Thailand's attempts to dismiss the issue.

In December 2012, the IPHRC met in Washington, DC for the first time. The IPHRC held meetings at the National Press Club, Capitol Hill and Freedom House discussing the issues of human rights defense in the OIC member states.

=== Observer Status dispute ===
The September 2014's high-level Summit of the OIC, in New York, ended without adopting any resolutions or conclusions, for the first time in several years in the modern history of the organization, due to a dispute regarding the status of one of its Observer states. [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] have demanded that the OIC remove the term 'Turkish Cypriot State' in reference to the unrecognized [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)]], which has observer status within the organization. Egypt's president [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] insisted that any reference to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus or Turkish Cypriot State" was unacceptable and was ultimately the reason for the OIC not adopting any resolutions or conclusions in the 2014 summit.<ref>[http://www.worldbulletin.net/headlines/145743/egypts-sisi-demands-turkish-cypriots-removed-from-oic] The World Bulletin news: Egypt's Sisi demands Turkish Cypriots removed from OIC</ref><ref>[http://sheikyermami.com/egypt-sisi-tells-turks-to-get-out-of-cyprus/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012082714/http://sheikyermami.com/egypt-sisi-tells-turks-to-get-out-of-cyprus/|date=12 October 2014}} Egypt's Sisi tells Turks to get out of Cyprus</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141012144555/http://www.newsit.com.cy/default.php?pname=Article&art_id=152107&catid=7] OIC says «NO» to «Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus»</ref>

== Criticism ==
OIC has been criticised by many Muslims for its lack of real engagement and solutions for Muslim countries in crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801041646/https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2018|title=OIC: 40 Years of Frustrations {{!}} {{!}} Al Jazeera|date=1 August 2018|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref> It is said to have made progress in social and academic terms but not politically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801041646/https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2018|title=OIC: 40 Years of Frustrations {{!}} {{!}} Al Jazeera|date=1 August 2018|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Shah Mahmood Qureshi|SM Qureshi]] criticized OIC for its stand with regards to [[Kashmir dispute|Kashmir issue]], stating with Pakistan might consider to call a meeting of Islamic countries that are ready to stand with them on the issue. This comment invited immediate retaliation from Saudi Arabia, where the latter forced Pakistan to repay 1 Billion dollars from the 3 Billion dollars loan it had taken in 2018 and by also ending its oil supply credit.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Harsha Kakar|title=Pakistan isolated on Kashmir|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/pakistan-isolated-kashmir-1502915906.html|access-date=12 August 2020|work=The Statesman|date=11 August 2020}}</ref>
