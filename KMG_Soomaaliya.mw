| quote = [[File:Monad.svg|11px]]<br />[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|188px]]<p> The [[gods]] [[conform]] scrupulously to the [[sentiments]] of their [[worshippers]]: they have [[reasons]] for so doing. Pay [[attention]] to this. â€¦ The Emperor [[Julian]]'s [[morals]] were almost those of [[w:Gregory of Nazianzus|St. Gregory Nazianzen]]. There is [[nothing]] in this but what is [[natural]] and usual. The transformations undergone by morals and [[ideas]] are never sudden. The greatest [[changes]] in [[social]] [[life]] are wrought imperceptibly, and are only seen from afar. [[Christianity]] did not secure a foothold until such [[time]] as the condition of morals accommodated itself to it, and as Christianity itself had become adjusted to the condition of morals. It was unable to substitute itself for [[paganism]] until such time as paganism came to resemble it, and itself came to resemble paganism.
