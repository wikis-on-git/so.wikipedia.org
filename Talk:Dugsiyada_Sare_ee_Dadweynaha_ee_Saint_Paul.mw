when translating the title "Saint Paul Public Schools" you wrote "'''Dugsiyada Sare ee Dadweynaha ee Saint Paul''" which i believe is wrong.

The correct translation for Saint Paul Public Schools is "'''Dugsiyada Dadweynaha ee Saint Pual'''".
Because when you use the word "sare" it changes the whole meaning to "high school" public schools.
