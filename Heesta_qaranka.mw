|This poem, indeed in heightened ''Jiifto'' form, was composed by Cali Mire Cawaale in 1947.  It’s the national anthem for the Republic of Somalia. It has been the most celebrated song in Somali for its patriotic awakening as well as in successfully criticizing the European colonizers that were very much in control of—like almost all nations in Africa—the Somali people’s agenda to rule their lands. In the following, I’ve attempted a rough translation of the song:


O wake up Somalis, wake up

And lean onto one another

Whoever is your weakest

Forever you support him

Quarrelling you may engage

Consoling you may entrust

That man has learned a lot

And his country he improved

Your binder surely is the law

Your language surely is one

Your territory surely is minute

You can’t divide over all of these

A small herd as your inheritance

Is brought before you to have

And equally you share and leave

Without your enemy intervening

For the sake of your looted camels

You face the death to retrieve ‘em

Yet all the missing lands of yours

None throws a “stone” to liberate ‘em

A nation’s weapons they manufacture

That are swords and nothing more

Let alone they make a telegram

What an anxiety, anxiety, big anxiety

Again and again I keep wailing

And from my heart I keep crying

For I’m a man whose country-s taken

By an enemy whom I find no ally [to defeat him]

[Again and again I keep crying

And that my tears are falling

To know I’m denied my freedom

To know that I’m an enslaved man]
