:Delete what? Why? [[User:PiRSquared17|PiRSquared17]] ([[User talk:PiRSquared17|talk]]) 19:13, 29 Nofeembar 2012 (UTC)

== Who asked to delete this article? ==

Do they know how long it takes to write an article? How much work it takes to re-correct that article again and again?
And do they even know why is it written? 
You need to understand all these factors before you easily say "delete" something.
