== History ==
=== Foundation ===<!-- Linked to this heading: 'Android, Inc.' redirect; 'Andy Rubin' article -->
Android, Inc. was founded in [[Palo Alto, California]], United States in October, 2003 by [[Andy Rubin]] (co-founder of [[Danger (company)|Danger]]),<ref name="AndyRubin">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04google.html?_r=2&hp=&pagewanted=all |title=I, Robot: The Man Behind the Google Phone |last=Markoff |first=John |date=November 4, 2007 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> [[Rich Miner]] (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/ |title=Introducing the Google Phone |first=Scott |last=Kirsner |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=September 2, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054533/http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/ |archivedate=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Nick Sears (once VP at [[T-Mobile USA|T-Mobile]]),<ref name="Nick">{{cite press release |url=http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/articles/t-mobile-nokia-N-Gage |title=T-Mobile Brings Unlimited Multiplayer Gaming to US Market with First Launch of Nokia N-Gage Game Deck |date=September 23, 2003 |publisher=T-Mobile |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> and Chris White (headed design and interface development at [[WebTV]])<ref name="AndroidInc"/> to develop, in Rubin's words "...smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences".<ref name="AndroidInc"/> Despite the obvious past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones.<ref name="AndroidInc"/>
That same year, Rubin ran out of money. [[Steve Perlman]], a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.<ref name="StevePerlman">{{cite news |url=http://www.airsla.org/broadcasts/BusinessWeek110802.mp3 |title=A Thousand Times Yes |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref>

=== Acquisition by Google ===
[[Google]] acquired Android Inc. on August 17, 2005, making Android Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc. Key employees of Android Inc., including Andy Rubin, Rich Miner and Chris White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.<ref name="AndroidInc"/> Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time of the acquisition, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the [[mobile phone]] market with this move.<ref name="AndroidInc"/>

=== Post-acquisition development ===
At [[Google]], the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the [[Linux kernel]]. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and [[Mobile network operator|carriers]] on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.<ref name="EngadgetMobileOS">{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/28/google-is-working-on-a-mobile-os-and-its-due-out-shortly |title=Google is working on a mobile OS, and it's due out shortly |last=Block |first=Ryan |work=[[Engadget]] |date=August 28, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118602176520985718-lMyQjAxMDE3ODA2MjAwMjIxWj.html |title=Google Pushes Tailored Phones To Win Lucrative Ad Market |last1=Sharma |first1=Amol |first2=Kevin J. |last2=Delaney |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref name="DT">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703031543/http://www.directtraffic.org/OnlineNews/Google_admits_to_mobile_phone_plan_18094880.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |url=http://www.directtraffic.org/OnlineNews/Google_admits_to_mobile_phone_plan_18094880.html |title=Google admits to mobile phone plan |work=directtraffic.org |publisher=Google News |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>

Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.<ref name="McKay">{{cite news |last=McKay |first=Martha |url=http://record-bergen.vlex.com/vid/iphone-phone-linksys-versatile-cordless-62885923 |title=Can iPhone become your phone?; Linksys introduces versatile line for cordless service |work=[[The Record (Bergen County)]] |page=L9 |date=December 21, 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-21 |quote=And don't hold your breath, but the same cell phone-obsessed tech watchers say it won't be long before Google jumps headfirst into the phone biz. Phone, anyone?}}</ref> Reports from the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Google wanted its search and applications on mobile phones and it was working hard to deliver that. Print and online media outlets soon reported rumors that Google was developing a Google-branded [[Handset#Telephony|handset]]. Some speculated that as Google was defining technical specifications, it was showing prototypes to cell phone manufacturers and network operators.

In September 2007, ''[[InformationWeek]]'' covered an [[Evalueserve]] study reporting that Google had filed several [[patent]] applications in the area of mobile telephony.<ref name="IWpatents">{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201807587&cid=nl_IWK_daily |title=Google's Secret Patent Portfolio Predicts gPhone |last=Claburn |first=Thomas |work=[[InformationWeek]] |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref name="MNpatents">{{cite web |url=http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-googles-strong-mobile-related-patent-portfolio |title=Google's Strong Mobile-Related Patent Portfolio |last=Pearce |first=James Quintana |work=mocoNews.net |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>
