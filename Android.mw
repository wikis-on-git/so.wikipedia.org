== History ==
=== Foundation ===<!-- Linked to this heading: 'Android, Inc.' redirect; 'Andy Rubin' article -->
Android, Inc. was founded in [[Palo Alto, California]], United States in October, 2003 by [[Andy Rubin]] (co-founder of [[Danger (company)|Danger]]),<ref name="AndyRubin">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04google.html?_r=2&hp=&pagewanted=all |title=I, Robot: The Man Behind the Google Phone |last=Markoff |first=John |date=November 4, 2007 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> [[Rich Miner]] (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/ |title=Introducing the Google Phone |first=Scott |last=Kirsner |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=September 2, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054533/http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/ |archivedate=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Nick Sears (once VP at [[T-Mobile USA|T-Mobile]]),<ref name="Nick">{{cite press release |url=http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/articles/t-mobile-nokia-N-Gage |title=T-Mobile Brings Unlimited Multiplayer Gaming to US Market with First Launch of Nokia N-Gage Game Deck |date=September 23, 2003 |publisher=T-Mobile |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> and Chris White (headed design and interface development at [[WebTV]])<ref name="AndroidInc"/> to develop, in Rubin's words "...smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences".<ref name="AndroidInc"/> Despite the obvious past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones.<ref name="AndroidInc"/>
That same year, Rubin ran out of money. [[Steve Perlman]], a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.<ref name="StevePerlman">{{cite news |url=http://www.airsla.org/broadcasts/BusinessWeek110802.mp3 |title=A Thousand Times Yes |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref>

=== Acquisition by Google ===
[[Google]] acquired Android Inc. on August 17, 2005, making Android Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc. Key employees of Android Inc., including Andy Rubin, Rich Miner and Chris White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.<ref name="AndroidInc"/> Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time of the acquisition, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the [[mobile phone]] market with this move.<ref name="AndroidInc"/>

=== Post-acquisition development ===
At [[Google]], the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the [[Linux kernel]]. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and [[Mobile network operator|carriers]] on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.<ref name="EngadgetMobileOS">{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/28/google-is-working-on-a-mobile-os-and-its-due-out-shortly |title=Google is working on a mobile OS, and it's due out shortly |last=Block |first=Ryan |work=[[Engadget]] |date=August 28, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118602176520985718-lMyQjAxMDE3ODA2MjAwMjIxWj.html |title=Google Pushes Tailored Phones To Win Lucrative Ad Market |last1=Sharma |first1=Amol |first2=Kevin J. |last2=Delaney |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref name="DT">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703031543/http://www.directtraffic.org/OnlineNews/Google_admits_to_mobile_phone_plan_18094880.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |url=http://www.directtraffic.org/OnlineNews/Google_admits_to_mobile_phone_plan_18094880.html |title=Google admits to mobile phone plan |work=directtraffic.org |publisher=Google News |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>

[[File:System-architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Architecture diagram]]
Android consists of a [[Kernel (software)|kernel]] based on the [[Linux kernel]], with [[middleware]], [[software library|libraries]] and [[Application programming interface|APIs]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[application software]] running on an [[application framework]] which includes Java-compatible libraries based on [[Apache Harmony]].

However, in September 2010, Linux kernel developer Rafael J. Wysocki added a patch that improved the mainline Linux wakeup events framework.

These alternative methods are still available with the latest Android.
; External storage: Most Android devices include microSD slot and can read microSD cards formatted with [[FAT32]], [[Ext3fs]] or [[Ext4fs]] file system. To allow use of high-capacity storage media such as [[USB flash drive]]s and [[USB HDD]]s, many Android tablets also include [[USB]] 'A' receptacle. Storage formatted with [[FAT32]] is handled by [[Linux Kernel]] VFAT driver, while 3rd party solutions are required to handle other popular file systems such as [[NTFS]], [[HFS+|HFS Plus]] and [[exFAT]].

== Applications ==
{{see also|Android software development|List of open source Android applications}}

Applications are usually developed in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language using the [[Android SDK|Android Software Development Kit]], but other development tools are available, including a [[Android software development#Native development kit|Native Development Kit]] for applications or extensions in C or C++, [[Google App Inventor]], a visual environment for novice programmers and various [[Multiple phone web based application framework|cross platform mobile web applications frameworks]].

=== Google Play (Android Market)===
[[File:Play Store app.png|thumb|upright|The [[Google Play|Play Store]] on the [[Galaxy Nexus]]]]
{{Main|Google Play}}

[[Google Play]], formerly ''Android Market'', is the online software store developed by Google for Android devices. An application program ("app") called "Market" is preinstalled on most Android devices and allows users to browse and download apps published by third-party developers, hosted on Android Market. As of October 2011 there were more than 300,000 apps available for Android, and the estimated number of applications downloaded from the Android Market as of December 2011 exceeded 10 billion.<ref name="t3appstats"/><ref name="wired10billion"/> The operating system itself is installed on 130 million total devices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/14/google-android-now-on-130-million-total-devices/ |title=Google Android now on 130M total devices, with 6B app downloads |publisher=TechCrunch |author=Alexia Tsotsis |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref>

Only devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements are allowed to preinstall Google's closed-source [[Google Play|Play Store]] app and access the Market.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html |title=Android Compatibility |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> The Market filters the list of applications presented by the Market app to those that are compatible with the user's device, and developers may restrict their applications to particular carriers or countries for business reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/compatibility.html |title=Android Compatibility |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

[[Google]] has participated in the Play Store by offering several applications themselves, including [[Google Voice]] (for the Google Voice service), Sky Map (for watching stars), Finance (for their finance service), Maps Editor (for their MyMaps service), Places Directory (for their Local Search), [[Google Goggles]] that searches by image, Gesture Search (for using finger-written letters and numbers to search the contents of the phone), Google Translate, Google Shopper, Listen for podcasts and My Tracks, a jogging application. In August 2010, Google launched "Voice Actions for Android",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/index.html |title=Voice Actions for Android |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> which allows users to search, write messages, and initiate calls by voice.

Alternatively, users can install apps directly onto the device if they have the application's [[APK (file format)|APK]] file or from third party app stores such as the [[Amazon Appstore]].<ref name="wired_alt_app_stores">{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/06/independent-app-stores-take-on-googles-android-market/ |title=Independent App Stores Take On Google's Android Market |date=June 11, 2010 |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |publisher=[[Wired News]] |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

=== Security ===
{{seealso|Mobile security}}
[[File:AndroidMarketPermissions.png|thumb|upright|An example of app permissions in Android Market.]]

Android applications run in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]], an isolated area of the operating system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are granted by the user when the application is installed. Before installing an application, [[Google Play|Play Store]] displays all required permissions.  A game may need to enable vibration, for example, but should not need to read messages or access the phonebook.  After reviewing these permissions, the user can decide whether to install the application.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/tech/security/index.html |title=Android Security Overview |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> The sandboxing and permissions system weakens the impact of vulnerabilities and bugs in applications, but developer confusion and limited documentation has resulted in applications routinely requesting unnecessary permissions, reducing its effectiveness.<ref name="demystified">{{cite paper |first1=Adrienne Porte |last1=Felt |first2=Erika |last2=Chin |first3=Steve |last3=Hanna |first4=Dawn |last4=Song |first5=David |last5=Wagner |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~afelt/android_permissions.pdf |title=Android Permissions Demystified |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of [[Wi-Fi]] access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like [[Foursquare (social network)|Foursquare]], [[Google Latitude|Latitude]], [[Facebook Places|Places]], and to deliver location-based ads.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/technology/09google.html?scp=1&sq=Skyhook%20Wireless%20v.%20Google%20Case%20Yields%20E-Mail%20Insight&st=cse |title=Suit Opens a Window Into Google |author=Steve Lohr |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 2011 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

There were two more internal releases, called "Astro" and "Bender".

== Intellectual property ==
=== Trademarks ===
In order to use the Android trademark, device manufacturers must ensure that the device complies with the Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) and then get permission from Google. Devices must also meet this definition to be eligible to license Google's closed-source applications, including the [[Google Play|Play Store app]].<ref name="Compatibility_FAQ">{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/faqs.html#compatibility |title=Android Open Source Project Frequently Asked Questions: Compatibility |work=source.android.com |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Participation in the compatibility program is free of charge.<ref name="android2"/>

In September 2010, [[Skyhook Wireless]] filed a lawsuit against Google in which they alleged that Google had used the compatibility document to block Skyhook's mobile positioning service (XPS) from Motorola's Android mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daringfireball.net//misc/2010/09/Skyhook-Google%20Complaint%20and%20Jury%20Demand.pdf |title=Skyhook Wireless, Inc. vs Google, Inc |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |format=pdf |quote=This entirely subjective review, conducted solely by Google employees with ultimate authority to interpret the scope and meaning of the CDD as they see fit, effectively gives Google the ability to arbitrarily deem any software, feature or function 'non-compatible' with the CDD.}}</ref> In December 2010 a judge denied Skyhook's motion for preliminary injunction, saying that Google had not closed off the possibility of accepting a revised version of Skyhook's XPS service, and that Motorola had terminated their contract with Skyhook because Skyhook wanted to disable Google's location data collection functions on Motorola's devices, which would have violated Motorola's obligations to Google and its carriers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=20416&sid=121 |title=Skyhook Wireless, Inc. vs. Google, Inc. |work=Social Law Library Research Portal |date=December 2010|accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

=== Licensing ===
The [[source code]] for Android is available under [[free and open source software]] licenses. [[Google]] publishes most of the code (including network and telephony [[solution stack|stacks]])<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Google-Open-Sources-Android-on-Eve-of-G1-Launch/ |work=[[eWeek]] |title=Google Open-Sources Android on Eve of G1 Launch |first=Clint |last=Boulton |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref> under the [[Apache License]] version 2.0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/posts/opensource |title=Android is now available as open source |work = Android Open Source Project |first=Dave |last=Bort |date=October 21, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090228170042/http://source.android.com/posts/opensource |archivedate=2009-02-28 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/source/licenses.html |title=Licenses: Android Open Source |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/11/why-google-chose-the-apache-software-license-over-gplv2.ars |title=Why Google chose the Apache Software License over GPLv2 for Android |author=Ryan Paul |work=Ars Technica |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> and the rest, Linux kernel changes, under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2.

The [[Open Handset Alliance]] develops the changes to the Linux kernel, in public, with source code publicly available at all times. The rest of Android is developed in private, with source code released publicly when a new version is released. Typically Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the [[Google Nexus]] series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/faqs.html#what-is-involved-in-releasing-the-source-code-for-a-new-android-version |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What is involved in releasing the source code for a new Android version? |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

In early 2011, Google chose to temporarily withhold the Android source code to the tablet-only Honeycomb release, the reason, according to [[Andy Rubin]] in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the [[Motorola Xoom]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Bray |first=Tim |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/04/i-think-im-having-gene-amdahl-moment.html |title=Android Developers Blog: I think I'm having a Gene Amdahl moment |publisher=Android-developers.blogspot.com |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> and they did not want third parties creating a "really bad user experience" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jerry Hildenbrand |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/google-not-open-sourcing-honeycomb-says-bloomberg |title=Honeycomb won't be open-sourced?

{{See also|Oracle Corporation#Lawsuit against Google}}
Both Android and Android phone manufacturers have been the target of numerous patent lawsuits. On 12 August 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language.<ref name="computerworld">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9180678/Update_Oracle_sues_Google_over_Java_use_in_Android |title=Update: Oracle sues Google over Java use in Android |first=James |last=Niccolai |date=August 12, 2010 |work=Computerworld |publisher=International Data Group Inc |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> Specifically, the patent infringement claim references seven United States patents including {{patent|US|5966702|"Method and apparatus for pre-processing and packaging class files"}}, and {{patent|US|6910205|"Interpreting functions utilizing a hybrid of virtual and native machine instructions"}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/35811761/Oracle-s-complaint-against-Google-for-Java-patent-infringement |title=Oracle's complaint against Google for Java patent infringement |publisher=[[scribd.com]] |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android is based on [[Apache Harmony]], a [[clean room design|clean room]] implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/10/google-oracle-android/ |title=Calling Oracle Hypocritical, Google Denies Patent Infringement |first=Ryan |last=Singel |date=October 5, 2010 |work=Wired News |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101005114201136 |title=Google Answers Oracle, Counterclaims, and Moves to Dismiss Copyright Infringement Claim |date=October 5, 2010 |work=Groklaw |publisher=Pamela Jones |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101111114933605 |title=Google Files Sizzling Answer to Oracle's Amended Complaint and its Opposition to Motion to Dismiss; updated 2Xs |date=November 11, 2010 |work=Groklaw |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>
