==What Is the European Union (EU).!!?==
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic alliance of 27 countries. The EU promotes democratic values in its member nations and is one of the world's most powerful trade blocs. Nineteen of the countries share the euro as their official currency.

The EU grew out of a desire to strengthen economic and political cooperation throughout the continent of Europe in the wake of World War II.

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $14.45 trillion euros in 2021. That's about $15.49 trillion dollars. The GDP of the U.S. for the same period was about $23 trillion.12

==KEY TAKEAWAYS !!?==
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic grouping of 27 countries committed to shared democratic values.
The euro is the shared official currency of 19 EU members known collectively as the eurozone.
In recent years, the EU has expanded to include many of the countries that had been Soviet Socialist States before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the 2016 referendum known as Brexit, the U.K. voted to leave the EU. It officially left in 2020.3

==History of the European Union (EU).!!==
The EU traces its roots to the European Coal and Steel Community, which was founded in 1950 and had just six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. It became the European Economic Community in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome and subsequently was renamed the European Community (EC).45

This served to deepen the integration of the member nations' foreign, security, and internal affairs policies. The EU established a common market the same year to promote the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital across its internal borders.

The EC initially focused on a common agricultural policy and the elimination of customs barriers. Denmark, Ireland, and the U.K. joined in 1973 in the first wave of expansion. Direct elections to the European Parliament began in 1979.5

==Creation of a Common Market.!!==
In 1986, the Single European Act embarked on a six-year plan to create a common European market by harmonizing national regulations.5

The '''Maastricht Treaty''' took effect in 1993, replacing the EC with the European Union (EU). The euro debuted as a common single currency for participating EU members on Jan. 1, 1999.6 Denmark and the U.K. negotiated "opt-out" provisions that permitted countries to retain their own currencies if they chose.7

Several newer members of the EU have also either not yet met the criteria for adopting the euro or chosen to opt out.

==The European Debt Crisis.!!==

In the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the EU and the European Central Bank struggled to deal with high sovereign debt and sluggish growth in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece.

Greece and Ireland received financial bailouts from the EU in 2010 conditioned on the implementation of fiscal austerity measures. Portugal followed in 2011. A second Greek bailout was needed in 2012.8

The crisis abated after the European Union and the European Central Bank adopted a series of measures to support the sovereign and banking-sector debt of the affected countries.

==Long-Term Measures.!!==

These included the establishment in October 2012 of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), established to assist EU members experiencing severe financial problems, including an inability to access the bond markets. The ESM supplanted the temporary European Financial Stability Facility backstop in place since 2010.9

The European Central Bank conducted a series of "targeted longer-term refinancing operations" in 2014, 2016, and 2019 to provide financing on favorable terms for EU financial institutions.10

In 2015, the European Union loosened the provisions of the 2011 Stability and Growth Act requiring member states to target public debt of below 60% of gross domestic product and annual government budget deficits below 3% of GDP over the medium term.11

The same year, a new EU agency, the Single Resolution Board, assumed responsibility for resolving bank failures in the euro area.12

==EU's North-South Issues.!!==
While the relief measures addressed the crisis, they haven't tackled one of its principal causes—the wide disparity in wealth and economic growth between the European Union's heavily industrialized north and its poorer southern periphery, which remains less urbanized and more dependent on agriculture.13

Because the industrialized north and the more rural south share a common currency, struggling southern economies can't take advantage of currency depreciation to improve their international competitiveness. Without currency depreciation, southern exporters ultimately struggle to compete with their northern rivals, which benefit from faster productivity growth.14

==How It Works in the U.S.!!?==
In the U.S., federal transfer payments help to address similar economic disparities between regions and states.

States with higher average incomes tend to contribute a disproportionately large share of federal revenue, while those with lower incomes tend to account for a higher share of federal outlays.15

In the European Union, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted joint spending measures some have called "an incomplete and fragile fiscal union in the making."16

==The Brexit Bomb.!!==

After rejecting earlier calls for a popular referendum on the U.K.'s European Union membership, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron promised a vote in 2013 and scheduled it in 2016. It was a time of growing popularity for the U.K. Independence Party, which opposed European Union membership.

After trailing in late polls, the Leave option won with nearly 52% of the vote on June 23, 2016. Cameron resigned the next day. The U.K. officially left the EU on Jan. 31, 2020.317

In July 2020, a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of the U.K. Parliament noted widespread media reports of Russian efforts on behalf of the Leave option and faulted the government for failing to investigate Russian involvement in British politics.1819.

==What Is the Purpose of the European Union.==
The European Union was created to bind the nations of Europe closer together for the economic, social, and security welfare of all. It is one of several efforts after World War II to bind together the nations of Europe into a single entity.20

==How Is the European Union Changing in the 21st Century.!!?==
The original members of the European Union were the nations of Western Europe. In the 21st century, the EU has expand membership to the Eastern European nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its current member nations include Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.20

==Why Was the European Union Created.!!==

The overarching purpose of the European Union, in the years after World War II, was to put an end to the devastating wars that had wracked Europe for centuries. At the same time, it became increasingly clear that a united Europe would have far greater economic and political power than the individual nations in the post-war world.21

Pros and Cons of the Euro

Fact checked by SUZANNE KVILHAUG
On Jan. 1, 1999, the European Union introduced its new currency, the euro.1 The euro was created to promote growth, stability, and economic integration in Europe. Originally, the euro was an overarching currency used for exchange between countries within the union. People within each nation continued to use their own currencies.

Within three years, however, the euro was established as an everyday currency and replaced the domestic currencies of many member states. The euro is still not universally adopted by all the EU members as the main currency. However, many of the holdouts peg their currencies to it in some way.

Given the enormous influence of the euro currency on the global economy, it is useful to look closely at its advantages and disadvantages. The euro, which is controlled by the European Central Bank (ECB),2 was launched with great fanfare and anticipation. However, the euro's considerable flaws became more apparent when it was tested by a series of challenges early in the 21st century.

==KEY TAKEAWAYS==
The euro was created on Jan. 1, 1999, and it was designed to support economic integration in Europe.2
The advantages of the euro include promoting trade, encouraging investment, and mutual support.
On the downside, the euro was blamed for overly rigid monetary policy and accused of a possible bias in favor of Germany.
Pros
==Promoting Trade==
The main benefits of the euro are related to increased trade. Travel was made easier by removing the need for exchanging money. More importantly, the currency risks were eliminated from European trade. With the euro, European businesses can easily lock in the best prices from suppliers in other eurozone countries. That makes prices transparent and increases the competition between firms in countries using the euro. Labor and goods can flow more easily across borders to where they are needed, making the whole union work more efficiently.


==Encouraging Investment==
The euro also supports cross-border investments within the eurozone. Investors in countries using foreign currencies face significant foreign exchange risk, which can lead to an inefficient allocation of capital. Although stocks also have exchange rate risks, the impact on bonds is far greater because of their lower volatility. The prices of most debt instruments are so stable that exchange rates influence returns far more than interest rates or credit quality. As a result, foreign currency bonds have a poor risk-return profile for most investors.

Before the euro, successful companies in countries with weak currencies still had to pay high interest rates. On the other hand, less efficient firms in nations with stable currencies enjoyed relatively low interest rates. The primary risk in lending across borders was the currency risk, instead of default risk. With the euro, investors in low interest rate countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, were able to lend money to firms in other eurozone countries without currency risk.

==Mutual Support==
In theory, the euro should help countries that adopt it to support each other during a crisis. The currencies of countries with larger economies tend to be more stable because they can spread risk more effectively. For example, even a prosperous small Caribbean country can be devastated by a hurricane. On the other hand, the U.S. state of Florida can turn to the rest of the United States to help rebuild after a hurricane. As a result, the U.S. dollar is one of the most stable currencies in the world.

The global crisis tested mutual support within the eurozone in 2020. Initially, there was not enough collective action. Even worse, many nations closed their borders to each other. However, the European Central Bank consistently bought up enough debt in afflicted countries, especially Italy, to keep interest rates relatively low. More importantly, France and Germany supported a recovery fund worth over 500 billion euros.3

Cons
==Rigid Monetary Policy==
By far, the largest drawback of the euro is a single monetary policy that often does not fit local economic conditions. It is common for parts of the EU to be prospering, with high growth and low unemployment. In contrast, others suffer from prolonged economic downturns and high unemployment.

The classic Keynesian solutions for these problems are entirely different. The high growth country ought to have high interest rates to prevent inflation, overheating, and an eventual economic crash. The low growth country should lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing. In theory, countries with high unemployment do not need to worry much about inflation because of the availability of the unemployed to produce more goods. Unfortunately, interest rates cannot be simultaneously raised in the high growth country and lowered in the low growth country when they have a single currency like the euro.

In fact, the euro caused precisely the opposite of standard economic policy to be implemented during the European sovereign debt crisis. As growth slowed and unemployment increased in countries like Italy and Greece, investors feared for their solvency, driving up interest rates. Typically, there would be no solvency fears for governments under a fiat money regime because the national government could order the central bank to print more money.

However, the European Central Bank's independence meant printing money was not an option for eurozone governments. Higher interest rates increased unemployment and even caused deflation and negative economic growth in some countries. It would be fair to say that the euro contributed to an economic depression in Greece.

==Possible Bias in Favor of Germany==
The first stage of the euro was the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), under which prospective future members of the eurozone fixed their exchange rates to the German mark. Germany has the largest economy in the eurozone and had a history of sound monetary policy since World War II.4 However, pegging exchange rates to the German mark may have created a bias in favor of Germany.

 The idea that the euro favors Germany is politically controversial, but there is some support for it.
In the 1990s, Germany pursued a looser monetary policy to deal with the burdens of reunification. As a result, the strong U.K. economy of that era experienced excessive inflation. The U.K. was first forced to raise interest rates and eventually pushed out of the ERM on Black Wednesday in 1992.

The German economy was relatively prosperous by 2012, and European monetary policy was far too tight for weaker economies. Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain all faced high debt, high interest rates, and high unemployment. This time, monetary policy was too tight rather than too loose. The only constant was that the euro continued to work in favor of Germany
