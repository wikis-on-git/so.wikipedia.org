Despite the failure of her previous drama ''Three Leaf Clover'', in 2007, Lee starred opposite [[Lee Dong-gun]] in the mini-drama ''If in Love... Like Them''.<ref name="chosun4">{{cite web|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|title=Is Sexy Girl Lee Hyo-lee Facing an Image Crisis?|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/01/02/2007010261004.html|date=January 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Eun-jung|title=Once Bitten but Not Twice Shy|url=http://www.hancinema.net/once-bitten-but-not-twice-shy-8092.html|work=[[The Korea Times]] via [[Hancinema]]|date=December 18, 2006}}</ref> Although originally announced as being only one episode long, it aired for four episodes on [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]]. An edited two-episode version of the drama also ran on SBS. During filming, part of a roof Lee was standing on collapsed. Only her foot fell through, but reportedly the fall might have been fatal if co-star Lee Dong-gun had not rescued her.

In February 2007, Lee announced her new digital single which would essentially be the soundtrack to ''If in Love... Like Them''. She performed all three main tracks from the single on ''[[Inkigayo]]'' on February 25, 2007. The lead song was "Toc Toc Toc" ({{ko-hhrm|톡톡톡||Toktoktok}}). Despite the single's genre being R&B, Lee began to sing more ballads afterwards, slowly moving away from her "sexy superstar" image.<ref name="chosun4" /> The single, although initially given a digital-only release, was given a limited retail release of only 30,000 copies. It was released on March 6, 2007, and in addition to the three tracks found in the digital single, it included a reworked version of "Toc Toc Toc." It was the best-selling album for that month, selling 27,845 copies.<ref name="miak2">{{cite web|title=Music Industry Association of Korea – March 2007|work=Music Industry Association of Korea|url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200703.htm|access-date=April 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708225146/http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200703.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=July 8, 2007}}</ref>

Although her single was commercially successful, her drama was heavily penalized for violating advertising guidelines, as ''If in Love... Like Them'' had several instances of overt product placement, in addition to using Lee's songs in the soundtrack. The Korean Broadcasting Committee ruled that the drama should not be aired in South Korea again, and that the network must apologize to its viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=5613|title=페이지를 찾을 수 없습니다.|website=world.kbs.co.kr|access-date=June 28, 2007|archive-date=May 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508102444/http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=5613|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During breaks in her solo music career, Lee also hosted various television programs, including ''Time Machine'' and ''[[Happy Together (2001 TV series)|Happy Together]]'', which she co-hosted with [[Yoo Jae-suk]] in 2006. On April 8, 2008, she joined [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]'s ''Sang Sang Plus'' as a co-host alongside Country Kkokko members [[Shin Jung-hwan]] and Tak Jae-hoon.<ref>[http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_musicnews_detail.htm?No=7326 ''Roundtable Plus'' Welcomes New Host E Hyo-lee].

She is also a former cast member of the variety show ''[[Family Outing]]'', appearing in only the first season. Mnet ran a 12-episode show called ''Off the Record: Lee Hyori'', which documented Lee's life on-set for three months; the show's purpose was to lessen the gap between the singer and her fans/anti-fans by letting them see that she is just another human being like everyone.

On December 20, 2008, Lee held her first solo concert ''Lee Hyori the Invincible'' at the [[Jamsil Arena]]. Upon release, tickets to the concert sold out in five minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lee Hyo-ri's First Solo Gig Sells Out in 5 Minutes|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/11/08/2008110861001.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=November 8, 2008}}</ref>

Her third studio album, ''[[It's Hyorish]]'', was released on July 14, 2008. "U-Go-Girl", the first single from the album, peaked at number 1 on online and offline charts, including various television music shows.

In November 2009, her contract with Mnet Media was set to expire.

{{Main|H-Logic|Monochrome (Lee Hyori album)}}
[[File:Lee_Hyori_from_acrofan.jpg|thumb|Lee in 2012]]
Almost two years after her previous album, Lee returned with ''[[H-Logic]]'' on April 12, 2010. The album has 14 tracks, including collaborations with [[Daesung]] from [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]], [[Jeon Ji-yoon]] from [[4Minute]], [[Rebekah Kim|Bekah]] from [[After School (band)|After School]], Gary from [[Leessang]], and Sangchu from [[Mighty Mouth]]. The singer worked also with [[E-Tribe]], the team behind "U-Go-Girl", the lead single from her previous album.

A music video was released for "Swing" ({{ko-hhrm|그네||Geune}}), featuring [[Gary (entertainer)|Gary]] from [[Leessang]], on March 31, 2010.  The lead single "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" and its music video were released soon after. The self-penned song, which features Ceejay (from Freshboyz), was released the same day as her album. She won two Mutizen Song awards on ''The Music Trend'' for her lead single within two weeks.

Soon after the release of the album ''H-Logic'', seven of its songs, composed by [[Bahnus]], were accused of plagiarism (among the allegedly plagiarized songs was "Bring It Back," performed by Canadian girl group Cookie Couture). On June 21, 2010, Lee admitted that the plagiarism accusations against her album were true, saying she had been "deceived"; she temporarily stopped all her activities as a singer and suspended her TV appearances.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lee Hyori admits plagiarism|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=June 20, 2010|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/06/201_67985.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lee Hyo-ri Admits New Songs Were Plagiarized|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/06/21/2010062100869.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=June 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lee Hyo-ri suspends TV appearances|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=July 8, 2010|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/07/135_69095.html}}</ref>

While on hiatus, Lee began to grow as a cultural influence. She wrote online columns for vernacular newspapers such as [[The Hankyoreh]] that mixed her thoughts on life and career with social commentary, and was well reviewed for her simple prose, humor and intelligence.<ref name="alternative">{{cite web|last=Baek|first=Byung-yeul|title=Alternative to Psy: Lee Hyo-ri is Miss Korea in new album|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/08/143_135220.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|access-date=May 6, 2013|date=May 6, 2013}}</ref> She also became an increasing presence in the civic community, emerging as one of the country's most high-profile [[animals rights]] [[Animal rights movement|activists]]. In 2011, Lee released two charity songs for donation to animal shelters, "Please Stay Behind" ({{ko-hhrm|남아 주세요||Nama Juseyo}}) and "Remember" ({{ko-hhrm|기억해||Gieokhae}}).
