==Administration==
Dear Soomaliga colleagues,

firstly: Sorry for not knowing Somali!

Your only admin [[User:Maax|Maax]] has not edited since 2013, [[:Category:Delete]] is quite full. How do you feel about your situation? Do you think help from outside the community is necessary? Is there someone who could take over the administrator job? [[user:Made4me|Made4me]] maybe, as regular editor? Sincerely, [[User:Man77|Man77]] ([[User talk:Man77|talk]]) 20:15, 8 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)
::Dear [[User:Man77|Man77]], it is true that our "only" admin is been inactive for sometime, and we need someone to take care of daily changes, like deal with vandalism and delete unwanted pages. As a regular editor, if granted permission, I can takecare of most of the vandalism and most of necessary daily basis duties.. But I believe there are others who are more suitable as a Somali admin including [[User:ismail4all|ismail4all]] and [[User:abshirdheere|abshirdheere]]. If there is no one else, I am ready. ''Note: an active Somali speaking admin is really very important for this Wikipedia.'' Thanks. [[User:Made4me|Made4me]] ([[User talk:Made4me|talk]]) 01:12, 9 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)
:::Thanks for your response. I have taken a look on the ongoings here every now and then for half a year and I am quite shocked how you are left alone in your situation, which is why I want to try do change it.
:::Could you start a discussion in a place, where you usually discuss things and where most of the community members would participate? I mean: Ask who is willing to do the job and (once you know who is willing) have some kind of poll? If one or two of you is/are able to get five others to support him (or her), I think and hope you will be granted a new admin.
:::I, however, think it will be better if these next steps are made by a Somali speaker, by someone who knows this wiki. As mentioned, I am not, and my Arabic is also way too bad to write sentences like these. If you need my support, feel free to ask at any time. Once you have your candidate(s) I for sure will advocate for you on meta wiki. Good luck, شكرا مرة أخرى, [[User:Man77|Man77]] ([[User talk:Man77|talk]]) 08:15, 9 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)</br>
ASC [[User:Made4me|Made4me]], [[User:Man77|Man77]]</br>thank you for your concern in Somali Wikipedia. For the last six months, there were a lot of vandalism and abusive pages here.. i personally have marked deletion for most of them, unfortunately there were no one to finish the job. That is why i want to run for admin. [[User:Made4me|Made4me]], [[User:Man77|Man77]] can i please get your support and guidance? i have already started a discussion and request page: [[Wikipedia:Codsiga maamulka/Oktoobar 2015]]. Thank you very much. [[User:Ismail4all|Ismail Suge]] ([[User talk:Ismail4all|talk]]) 17:10, 10 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)

::Salaam [[User:Man77|Man77]], and [[User:Ismail4all|Ismail Suge]], thank you for your contribution and continued support here in Somali Wikipedia. It is very urgent matter to get admin in here, and I already said I fully support you and will keep working with you now and then. I have seen your request and voted for you. I don't know who is deciding your admin status. [[User:Man77|Man77]] is a fellow Wikipedian and will help you too. Good luck and let me know what happens next. [[User:Made4me|Made4me]] ([[User talk:Made4me|talk]]) 03:03, 11 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)

:::[[User:Made4me|Made4me]] aad ayaad u mahadsan tahay walaal. wixii soo kordha waan kula socodsiin doona. [[User:Ismail4all|Ismail Suge]] ([[User talk:Ismail4all|talk]]) 03:16, 11 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)

::::[[user:Ismail4all|Ismail4all]]: Thanks for your candidacy. The decision will finally be made by Wikimedia [[:meta:stewards|stewards]] after a request is placed [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Steward_requests/Permissions#Administrator_access here]. The request should include a link to a community approval, which is why I recommend to wait until you have five supporting votes (not counting mine as I do not consider myself part of the Somali Wikipedia community) or until at least ten days have passed since the start of the poll. Good luck, [[User:Man77|Man77]] ([[User talk:Man77|talk]]) 19:14, 13 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)
:::::Hi [[User:Man77|Man77]], thank you for helpful info, i have already submitted the request and it is on hold - i think it is because of waiting for the ten days or so. Thank you very much for all the support. [[User:Ismail4all|Ismail Suge]] ([[User talk:Ismail4all|talk]]) 14:35, 14 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)

== presenting the project Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory and asking for a vounteer in Somali Wikipedia ==

Hello everyone,
My name is Marc Miquel and I am a researcher from Barcelona (Universitat Pompeu Fabra). While I was doing my PhD I studied whether an identity-based motivation could be important for editor participation and I analyzed content representing the editors' cultural context in 40 Wikipedia language editions. Few months later, I propose creating the '''Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory''' in order to raise awareness on Wikipedia’s current state of cultural diversity, providing datasets, visualizations and statistics, and pointing out solutions to improve intercultural coverage. 

I am presenting this project to a grant and I expect that the site becomes a useful tool to help communities create more multicultural encyclopaedias and bridge the content culture gap that exists across language editions (one particular type of systemic bias). For instance, this would help spreading cultural content local to Somali Wikipedia into the rest of Wikipedia language editions, and viceversa, make Somali Wikipedia much more multicultural.
Here is the link of the project proposal:
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Wikipedia_Cultural_Diversity_Observatory_(WCDO)

I am searching for a volunteer in each language community: I still need one for the Somali Wikipedia. If you feel like it, you can contact me at: marcmiquel *at* gmail.com I need a contact in your every community who can (1) check the quality of the cultural context article list I generate to be imported-exported to other language editions, (2) test the interface/data visualizations in their language, and (3) communicate the existance of the tool/site when ready to the language community and especially to those editors involved in projects which could use it or be aligned with it. Communicating it might not be a lot of work, but it will surely have a greater impact if done in native language! :). '''If you like the project, I'd ask you to endorse it in the page I provided.''' In any case, I will appreciate any feedback, comments,... Thanks in advance for your time! Best regards, --[[User:Marcmiquel|Marcmiquel]] ([[User talk:Marcmiquel|talk]]) 15:30, 10 Oktoobar 2017 (UTC) Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona

== Temp sysop flag ==
Due to the hundreds of pages being created that are machine translated from the English Wikipedia, I request temporary (48-72 hour) admin permissions to delete the pages in question. Thanks, [[User:Vermont|Vermont]] ([[User talk:Vermont|talk]]) 20:52, 4 Nofeembar 2018 (UTC)
:Consider this withdrawn. I’ve posted on [[meta:SRM]] asking for the deletions. [[User:Vermont|Vermont]] ([[User talk:Vermont|talk]]) 14:42, 26 Nofeembar 2018 (UTC)

== Temporary adminship request ==
I have been asked [[:meta:Special:Permalink/18849013#Deletions on sowiki|on SRM]] to request adminship to deal with the continuing abuse of Episilon212 and their sockpuppets, uploading copyright violations. As the abuse is likely to continue with more accounts, as it has since my initial report and blocking of the master in November, I request temporary adminship to monitor and deal with the issue. Thank you, [[User:Vermont|Vermont]] ([[User talk:Vermont|talk]]) 11:09, 5 Febraayo 2019 (UTC)

== Global bot policy proposal: invitation to a Meta discussion ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{int:hello}}!

I apologize for sending a message in English. {{int:please-translate}}. According to [[:m:Bot_policy/Implementation#Where_it_is_policy|the list]], your wiki project currently is opted in to the [[:m:Bot_policy#Global_bots|global bot policy]]. Under this policy, bots that fix double redirects or maintain interwiki links are allowed to operate under a global bot flag that is assigned directly by the stewards.

As the Wikimedia projects developed, the need for the current global bot policy decreased, and in the past years, no bots were appointed via that policy. That is mainly given Wikidata were estabilished in 2013, and it is no longer necessary to have dozens of bots that maintain interwiki links.

A [[:m:Requests for comment/Refine global bot policy|proposal]] was made at Meta-Wiki, which proposes that the stewards will be authorized to determine whether an uncontroversial task may be assigned a global bot flag. The stewards already assign permissions that are more impactful on many wikis, namely, [[:m:GS|global sysops]] and [[:m:GR|global renamers]], and I do not think that trust should be an issue. The stewards will assign the permission only to time-proven bots that are already approved at a number of projects, like [[:m:User:ListeriaBot|ListeriaBot]].

By this message, I would like to invite you to comment [[:m:Requests for comment/Refine global bot policy|in the global RFC]], to voice your opinion about this matter.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,<br />

== Proposal: Set two-letter project shortcuts as alias to project namespace globally ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{int:please-translate}}

Hello everyone,

I apologize for posting in English. I would like to inform everyone that I created a new global request for comment (GRFC) at Meta Wiki, which may affect your project: [[:m:Requests for comment/Set short project namespace aliases by default globally]].

In this GRFC, I propose that two-project shortcuts for project names will become a default alias for the project namespace. For instance, on all Wikipedias, WP will be an alias to the Wikipedia: namespace (and similar for other projects). Full list is available in the GRFC.

This is already the case for Wikivoyages, and many individual projects asked for this alias to be implemented. I believe this makes it easier to access the materials in the project namespace, as well as creating shortcuts like <tt>WP:NPOV</tt>, as well as helps new projects to use this feature, without having to figure out how to request site configuration changes first.

As far as I can see, {{SITENAME}} currently does not have such an alias set. This means that such an alias will be set for you, if the GRFC is accepted by the global community.

I would like to ask all community members to participate in the request for comment at Meta-Wiki, see [[:m:Requests for comment/Set short project namespace aliases by default globally]].

Please feel free to [[:m:User talk:Martin Urbanec|ask me]] if you have any questions about this proposal.

Best regards,<br />

== Global bot policy changes ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{int:hello}}!

I apologize for sending a message in English. {{int:please-translate}}. According to [[:m:Bot_policy/Implementation#Where_it_is_policy|the list]], your wiki project is currently opted in to the [[:m:Bot_policy#Global_bots|global bot policy]]. As such, I want to let you know about some changes that were made after the [[:m:Requests for comment/Refine global bot policy|global RfC]] was closed.

*Global bots are now subject to a 2 week discussion, and it'll be publicized via a MassMessage list, available at [[:m:Bot policy/New global bot discussion|Bot policy/New global bot discussion]] on Meta. Please subscribe yourself or your wiki if you are interested in new global bots proposals.
*For a bot to be considered for approval, it must demonstrate it is welcomed in multiple projects, and a good way to do that is to have the bot flag on at least 5 wikis for a single task.
*The bot operator should make sure to adhere to the wiki's preference as related to the use of the bot flag (i.e., if a wiki doesn't want a bot to use the flag as it edits, that should be followed).

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,<br />
