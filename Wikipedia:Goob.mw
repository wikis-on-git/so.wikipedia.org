==Administration==
Dear Soomaliga colleagues,

firstly: Sorry for not knowing Somali!

Your only admin [[User:Maax|Maax]] has not edited since 2013, [[Category:Delete]] is quite full. How do you feel about your situation? Do you think help from outside the community is necessary? Is there someone who could take over the administrator job? [[user:Made4me|Made4me]] maybe, as regular editor? Sincerely, [[User:Man77|Man77]] ([[User talk:Man77|talk]]) 20:15, 8 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)
::Dear [[User:Man77|Man77]], it is true that our "only" admin is been inactive for sometime, and we need someone to take care of daily changes, like deal with vandalism and delete unwanted pages. As a regular editor, if granted permission, I can takecare of most of the vandalism and most of necessary daily basis duties.. But I believe there are others who are more suitable as a Somali admin including [[User:ismail4all|ismail4all]] and [[User:abshirdheere|abshirdheere]]. If there is no one else, I am ready. ''Note: an active Somali speaking admin is really very important for this Wikipedia.'' Thanks. [[User:Made4me|Made4me]] ([[User talk:Made4me|talk]]) 01:12, 9 Oktoobar 2015 (UTC)
