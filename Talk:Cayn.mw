First all, correction: cayn is not part of somalia or puntland. the capitol city of cayn is caynaba and caynaba is definitely an integral part of somaliland. cayn was never and is never going to belong to ssc or puntland. it is just a day dream. secondly, try to be impartial in this discussion and use your human intelligent. that is if you have any grain of common sense left in your head. question: who started the war. the answer: the ssc, who are proven without a shadow of doubt to have close work relationship with al-shabaab and ONLF. they sprayed bullet at innocent people in kalshaale, who were in prayer- salat el-eid. would you want to call those muslims. they killed 7 prayers and wounded around 14. but they lost some themselves. then they attacked a SURF (car) which belonged to somaliland army who there only to go in between the warring factions. that is say to keep peace. they wounded one of the bodygaurds of the commander. that is why somaliland military liquidated a bunch of tags who were posing perpetual danger to peace. then the so called ssc terrorist group attacked, unprovoked, the positions of the somaliland army more than 3 times. somaliland are army, who, remember, were trying to be impartial and to keep the peace. of course, they defended themselves and inflicted heavy loss to those anti-peace elements, who are just looking for to pick up a fight with somaliland. so who are the blood thirsty group in somaliland. the answer: again- the so called ssc. whatever happened to them they brought it on to themselves. you people are now shedding a crocodile tears. 
silaanyo, the elected president of somaliland (remember even dhulbahante subclan elected him)was and is still calling to those people for peace. he is a man of peace. the ssc are not. so wake up and be fair.
