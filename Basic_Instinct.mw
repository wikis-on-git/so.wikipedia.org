Eszterhas developed the script in the 1980s. It became a subject of a bidding war until [[Carolco Pictures]] acquired the rights to the film. From there, Verhoeven signed on to direct and Douglas and Stone joined the project, after many actresses were considered for the role of Tramell. Before its release, ''Basic Instinct'' generated controversy due to its overt sexuality and violence, including a rape scene. Gay rights activists criticized the film's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous [[psychopath]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leistedt|first1=Samuel J.|last2=Linkowski|first2=Paul|title=Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction?|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|date=January 2014|volume=59|issue=1|pages=167â€“174|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12359|pmid=24329037|s2cid=14413385}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|title=Dr. Fredricks Cinema Therapy Blog - Narcissistic personality disorder|publisher=Dr. Randi Fredricks, PhD|access-date=2014-04-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915022411/http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|archive-date=September 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In one scene, Stone's [[vulva]] was filmed as she crossed her legs, which she claims was done without her knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Owoseje|first=Toyin|date=2021-03-20|title=Sharon Stone says she was misled about explicit interrogation scene in 'Basic Instinct': Vanity Fair|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/sharon-stone-says-she-was-misled-about-explicit-interrogation-scene-in-basic-instinct-vanity-fair-1.5355419|access-date=2021-03-21|website=CTVNews|language=en|archive-date=March 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320155149/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/sharon-stone-says-she-was-misled-about-explicit-interrogation-scene-in-basic-instinct-vanity-fair-1.5355419|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Basic Instinct 2006" />
