Wax-qorista Wikipedia waa mid fudud marka aad fahanto. Barta Wikipedia waxay isticmaashaa labo nidaam marka wax la bedelayo/qorayo; kuwaasi oo kala ah: qoraal-bedel caadi ah (wikitext) iyo nidaam cusub oo loo yaqaano aragti-bedel (visualeditor). Hadaba si aad marka hore u soo alamiiteyso waxaad samaysaa bog tijaabo ah adigoo aadaya '''[[Wikipedia:Bacaadka|Bacaadka]]'''. Waxaad halkaas ku samayn kartaa qoraalo tijaabo ah si aad u fahanto nidaamka iyo qaabka Wikipedia wax loogu qoro.

==Qaabka Wax ka bedel xogta==
{{Main|Help:Editing}}
Wiki markup editing is chosen by clicking the <tt>Edit</tt> tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a [[Wikipedia: Section|section-edit link]]). This will take you to a new page containing the editable contents of the current page. Wiki markup is used extensively throughout Wikipedia for such things as [[Help:Link|hyperlinks]], [[Help:Table|tables]] and [[Help:Columns|columns]], [[Help:Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Wikipedia:Inline citation|inline citation]], [[Help:Special characters|special characters]] and so on.

The VisualEditor option is intended as a user-friendly, [[WYSIWYG|"What You See Is What You Get"]] (WYSIWYG) editing aid allowing one to edit pages without the need to learn wikitext markup. It is only available to registered logged-in users through an opt-in choice available through [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|personal preferences]], see the [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor user guide]] for more information.

===Edit summary===
First, any time you edit a page, it is considered good [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|etiquette]] (or "Wikiquette") to enter an explanation of your changes in the '''[[Help:Edit summary|Edit summary]]''' box, which you will find below the edit window. It is okay for your explanation to be quite short. For example, if you are making a spelling correction, you might just type "typo."  Also, if the change you have made to a page is minor, such as correcting a spelling or grammar error, check the box "This is a [[Help:Minor edit|minor edit]]" (this box is only available if you have logged in). 

<div style="float: right; background-color:#f5faff; color: #000; padding: .2em .6em; font-size: 100%; border: 1px solid #cedff2; margin-bottom:3px;">'''For more information, see [[Help:Edit summary]]'''</div>{{-}}

===Show preview===  
Second, you should always use the '''[[Help:Show preview|Show preview]]''' button. After you have entered a change in the edit box, click the <!-- Can someone put an actual button here to make things clear to newusers? -->'''{{Mediawiki:Showpreview}}''' button instead of '''Save page'''. This lets you see what the page will look like after your edit, ''before'' you actually save. We all make mistakes; this feature helps you catch them before other people see them. Using '''{{Mediawiki:Showpreview}}''' before saving also lets you try format changes and other edits without cluttering up the [[Help:Page history|page history]].

=== Save the page===
Provided an edit summary? Previewed the page? Then you are ready for the final step: Click the '''Save page''' button.

==Media files==
[[File:Editing basics - Uploading and adding images.webm|thumb|A screencast that walks through how to upload files to Wikimedia Commons and add them to Wikipedia articles.]]
Images, sounds and videos enhance articles greatly. A file that is already hosted on Wikipedia or the [[Wikimedia Commons]] can be inserted with the basic code "<code><nowiki>[[File:FILENAME|thumb|DESCRIPTION]]</nowiki></code>". ("<code>Image:</code>" can be substituted for "<code>File:</code>" with no change in effect; the choice between the two is purely a matter of editorial preference.) Using "<code>thumb</code>" generates a [[thumbnail]] of an image (the most common placement option), which is typically sized differently from the original image. Several options can affect a thumbnail's placement and size, and there are other methods for placing images not in a thumbnail format, such as in a frame, table or "infobox", which this summary page does not delve into. 

Only [[Help:Logging in|logged in]] users can [[Help:Files|upload files]] under an [[Wikipedia:File names|appropriate title]]. The first step in uploading a file is to determine its [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright status]]. The Wikimedia Commons' [[Commons:Special:UploadWizard|File Upload Wizard]] and Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:File Upload Wizard|File Upload Wizard]], will guide you through the process of submitting media. All files uploaded are [[mirror (computing)|mirrored]] between Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, and searchable from either one.

==Renaming articles==
[[File:Vector hidden move button.png|thumb|The [[WP:MOVE|move]] option appears when you hover your mouse cursor over the "More" drop-down menu, shown here]]
If you find an article that you believe is misnamed, please do not copy and paste the contents of the old article into a new article — among other things, it separates the previous contributions from their edit history (which we need to keep track of for [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] reasons). The preferred method is to '''move''' the page to the new name (you need to be registered to be able to do that). If it is your first move, please read the warnings on the move page carefully, as there are a number of issues to consider before moving a page. Principles for choosing titles of articles are described under [[Wikipedia:Article titles]]. If a "disambiguation" page is involved, it is best to review [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation]].

<div style="float: right; background-color:#f5faff; color: #000; padding: .2em .6em; font-size: 100%; border: 1px solid #cedff2; margin-bottom:3px;">'''For more information, see [[Help:Moving a page]]'''</div>{{-}}

==Creating articles==
[[File:How to create a Wikipedia article - Right to science and culture.ogv|thumb|A screencast demonstrating how to create a Wikipedia article manually.]]
Before [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|starting a new article]] please understand [[Wikipedia:Notability|Wikipedia's notability requirements]]. In short, the topic of an article must have already been the subject of publication in [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]], such as books published by major publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals and websites that meet the same requirements as reputable print-based sources. Information on Wikipedia must be verifiable; if no reliable [[Wikipedia:Third-party sources|third-party]] sources can be found on a topic, then it should not have a separate article. Wikipedia's concept of notability applies this basic standard to avoid [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE|indiscriminate]] inclusion of topics.

An [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] is available to help you create articles — it is not required but will help you construct  better articles. Only [[Special:CreateAccount|registered users]] may create articles directly, though people editing by their IP addresses can submit a proposed article through the [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation|Articles for Creation]] process, where it will be reviewed and considered for publication. Before creating an article, please [[Wikipedia:Searching|search]] Wikipedia first to make sure that an article does not ''already exist'' on the subject, and please also review the [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article titling policy]] for guidance of what to name the article.

<div style="float: right; background-color:#f5faff; color: #000; padding: .2em .6em; font-size: 100%; border: 1px solid #cedff2; margin-bottom:3px;">'''For more details on how to create an article, see [[Wikipedia:Your first article]]'''</div>{{-}}

==Protected pages==
Some pages are [[WP:Protection policy|protected from editing]]. These pages have a <tt>View source</tt> tab instead of an <tt>Edit</tt> tab. You can still edit these pages indirectly, by submitting an "[[Wikipedia:Edit requests|edit request]]"&nbsp;– a user with the ability to edit the protected page will respond to your request. You can submit a request by clicking on the <tt>View source</tt> tab on that page and using the "Submit an edit request" link at the bottom right.

<div style="float: right; background-color:#f5faff; color: #000; padding: .2em .6em; font-size: 100%; border: 1px solid #cedff2; margin-bottom:3px;">'''For more information, see [[Help:Protection]]'''</div>{{-}}

==Getting reverted== 
If you ever make a change that gets [[Wikipedia:Reverting|reverted]] by another editor, discuss the change on the  [[Wikipedia:Talk pages|talk page]]! The [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle|BOLD, revert, discuss cycle]] is a popular method of reaching consensus, and may be useful for identifying objections, keeping discussion moving forward and helping to break deadlocks.  [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|Edit warring]] (repeatedly overriding or reimplementing contributions) is highly discouraged.  There is a bright-line rule called the ''[[WP:3RR|three-revert rule]]'', the violation of which may lead someone to be [[WP:BLOCK|blocked]] from editing to prevent further disruption. [[WP:DISRUPTSIGNS|Disruptive editing]] is not always intentional, as new editors may simply not understand [[Wikipedia:Here to build an encyclopedia|the ins and outs of Wikipedia]]. 

<div style="float: right; background-color:#f5faff; color: #000; padding: .2em .6em; font-size: 100%; border: 1px solid #cedff2; margin-bottom:3px;">'''For more information, see [[Wikipedia:Reverting]]'''</div>{{-}}

==VisualEditor ==
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|frameless|200px|right]]
[[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] is a way to edit pages without needing to learn wikitext markup. It works more like a [[word processing]] application and is only available to registered, logged-in editors who have [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing|opted in]].{{-}}
