[[File:Tea-224-nevit.jpg|thumb|400px|Shaax]] There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya, a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)!


If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won’t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like – full of spices and sugar! Cardamom and cinommen is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah. Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze!

Tea with milk is called shaah cadays, however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal.
 Ingredients:

2 cups of water
1 cup of milk
2 teaspoons of tea leaves (use a strong tea like Kenyan)
6 cardamom pods

2 cloves
Sugar to taste

Instructions:

1. Grind all the spices
