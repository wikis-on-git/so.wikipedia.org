'''operating system''' ('''habka shididu''') waxaa weeyi group software ah oo maamula dhismaha computerka [[computer hardware]] kaasoo u keena adeegyo isku mida prograamada computerka.  

An '''operating system''' ('''OS''') is a set of software that  manages [[computer hardware]] resources and provide common services for [[computer program]]s. The operating system is a vital component of the [[system software]] in a computer system. Application programs require an operating system to function.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and [[dynamic memory allocation|memory allocation]], the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,<ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | title = Operating Systems, Internals and Design Principles | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | location = Pearson |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dhotre| first = I.A.| title = Operating Systems. | publisher = Technical Publications | year = 2009 |page=1}}</ref> although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make a [[system call]] to an OS function or be interrupted by it. Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computerâ€”from [[cellular phone]]s and [[video game console]]s to [[supercomputer]]s and [[web server]]s.

Examples of popular modern operating systems include <!--Ordered alphabetically per discussion consensus; please do not re-order without discussing it on the talk page; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Operating_system#Market_share_changes.3B_the_alphabet_doesn.27t --> [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BSD]], [[iOS]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]],<ref name="netapplications">{{cite web| url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10| title=Operating System Market Share| publisher=Net Applications}}</ref> [[Windows Phone]], and [[IBM z/OS]]. All these, except Windows and z/OS, share roots in [[UNIX]].
