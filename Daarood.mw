The '''Daarood''' ('''Darod''') is the most influencing and noted tribe in the Eastern African history, from the time of the Egyptian era up till now.

They are the most influencing people in the Horn of [[Africa]] both in the politics and the financial sector.

Since their absence in the capital of [[Soomaaliya]], [[Muqdisho]], the country became a lawless place where international criminals can enjoy the absence of law and order.

They make up 60% of Somali population in [[Soomaaliya]], 80% of [[Ogaden|Ogadenia]] and 70% of NFD (Northern [[Kenya]]).

In [[Soomaaliya]] they populate in the North, South, East and West.
