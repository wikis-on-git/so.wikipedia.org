'''Registering a username''' is optional, but encouraged.  You do not need to give your name or any personal details to register. 

Everyone can contribute to Wikipedia, regardless of whether they choose to register. However, there are several benefits to registering a username, including:
[[File:Nice People MEDIUM.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3:52|A short video about people like you who edit Wikipedia. <small>(1:26 min)</small>]]
*The ability to create new articles.
*Having an account gives you many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|extra features]], including more editing options and user preferences. One handy feature is the [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]], which makes it easier for you to track changes to pages you are interested in. Another is the ability to [[Help:Moving a page|move or rename a page]]. (Do not move pages simply through copying and pasting as the edit history is not preserved that way. Instead, ask at the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village pump]] for a registered user's help.)
*An unregistered user is identified by his or her computer's [[IP address]], which is used as their public identifier when making contributions (and signing comments on talk pages). Your computer's IP address can often be used to find information about you, so registering '''''increases''''' your privacy by making your IP address non-visible to other editors. Also, because IP addresses often change, unregistered users sometimes find it more difficult to gain respect and recognition from other editors through building a good track record. It can also be more difficult to carry on conversations with such non-registered users since they lack a unique [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]]. For these reasons, many Wikipedians consider registering to indicate a greater willingness by you to stand behind your edits, and your comments on discussion pages. This means your contributions to articles and discussion pages will generally be given more weight.
*Some pages, such as this page, require users to be [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed]] before they may be edited. This ability is automatically given to registered users who have been on Wikipedia for at least four days and have made ten edits, but is not given to unregistered users, regardless of the number of edits made.
*Only registered users are allowed to become [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] (also known as sysops). 

If you register, do not forget your password or your user name. If you are prone to forgetting these, make sure you enter your email address as part of signing up, so you can have a new password sent to you if you forget your current one.

See [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|Why create an account?]] for more information.

==How to register==
To register, click above, or click the <span class="plainlinks">[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin/signup?returnto=Wikipedia:Tutorial+(Registration) Log in/create an account]</span> link at the top right corner of any page. 

You won't be able to (easily) change your username once you choose it, so reading the [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]] before creating a username is highly recommended.
