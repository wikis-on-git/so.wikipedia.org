The Somali text formerly posted here is from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - see http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm.  It has absolutely no place here - it is completely irrelevant, as well as being POV.  The way to welcome Somali speakers is to write instructions in languages they are likely to understand (Italian should be added as well as Arabic and English), not paste irrelevant material that they will understand but not see the point of. When a Somali finds this page, they can translate it and we can get rid of the other languages (though to use the edit links they'll have to speak English anyway.) In the meantime, please stop reverting. - [[User:Mustafaa|Mustafaa]] 17:43, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Do you even know Arab? Your Arab text doesn't even say this is the Somali Wikipedia, and it doesn't link to English or Italian wikipediaS! ----

Why would it link to the English or Italian Wikipedias?  If the reader knows English or Italian, he can already read the English and Italian text and click on the appropriate links.

:Then why do the English and Italian sections link to Arab and each others Wikipedias?

Now - I don't think you speak Somali, given your edit record, but if you do, then why not write an explanation of Wikipedia for the main page, such as you can see on the main page of the English and Arabic Wikipedias (or, indeed, every active Wikipedia in any language), or even start work on translating the interface into Somali?  And if you don't, then what possible business do you have getting rid of my list of suggested articles?

:Oh, so I created article in Somali but obviously I cant speak it. OK. What possible business do you have sabotaging my edits, when you don't speak Somali?

Finally, I have nothing against an Osmanya section of this Wikipedia - let Somalis decide whether it's any use to them or not, though my bet is not - but given that Unicode Osmanya is found neither in Arial Unicode MS nor even in the remarkably complete Unicode font Code2000, it would be a good idea to add a link to a font that will let people read it.  My computer has unusually good Unicode support, and it still shows up as a bunch of question marks. - [[User:Mustafaa|Mustafaa]] 00:02, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Let somalis decide? I have already decided. If other Somalis disagree, there can be a discussion among Somalis. And of course Code2000 doesn't support it, you need Code2001 for plane1 support...

Very obviously, you can't speak Somali.  The "article" you created consists of a single sentence.  In rather a long time on this Wikipedia you have totally failed to translate its main page, its interface, or anything else longer than a couple of words recently into Somali, and when I made grammatical errors in Somali (maqaalo instead of maqaaladii) you didn't correct them.  I wouldn't be surprised if even the four-word article you wrote is grammatically wrong.  I've written longer articles in Tajik, and I don't speak Tajik either. In fact, I've now written articles in Somali here too... Even if you could speak Somali, your editing pattern is incredibly unproductive, verging on vandalism in the case of your repeated insertion of UDHR text over the main page. So try to go with the Wiki flow here, and add to this nearly empty Wikipedia rather than jealously guarding it against any expansion. - [[User:Mustafaa|Mustafaa]] 22:30, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Wow. I created 5 articles. I have very little time for this Wikipedia, most of my intention here is to watch it for vandals and non-Somali pedants like you, and to be there to welcome new users. I never inserted UDHR text "over" the mainpage. It *was* the mainpage - replacing Engish content with Somali content, a placeholder until someone else comes or I have spare time. I am not guarding this wikipedia against expansion. I am guarding it against vandals like you who just add nonsense and garbage and who try to insult me by telling me I don't speak my mother language.

The reason your adition is not relevant is because you place quraan so high above everything else, and many of your topics are irrelevant compared to other and since the page don't exist it's stupid hoping somebody will write them without knowing about Wikipedia a little. ----

Not at all.  Having redlinks substantially increases the chances that someone will stumble across this page accidentally while searching the Internet in Somali and read about Wikipedia and its goals.  If they come here and find nothing but a paragraph of the UDHR, they'll wonder what the heck's going on and go away.  Whereas if they find brief instructions in three other languages - or better yet, in Somali, as they should be - and a bunch of suggested articles waiting to be written, they might actually get involved in the project.  You claim you've had no time to improve the Wikipedia; how long does it take you to translate a few simple sentences into what you claim is your mother tongue?  You may be Somali, but you still haven't done anything that would convince me that you speak Somali.  And if your strange enmity towards me leads you to add more serious Somali content (sentences containing a verb more complicated than "is" would be a start...) and show me that I'm wrong, then I for one will be glad of it. - [[User:Mustafaa|Mustafaa]] 10:44, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Article count ==

Could someone who knows this language please add the article count to the Main Page using the <nowiki>{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}</nowiki> template? (It currently shows {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} articles.)  Please display it in an "obvious" way (say, '''bold''' and linked to [[Special:Statistics]]) so someone like me, who doesn't know the language, can still tell it's the article count. Thanks. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 09:33, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

==Templates==

there are no existing templates for this wiki and the ones I tried to get from the main english one do not work on this one. I would like to ask anyone who contribute to mail me at scabdirisaq@yahoo.com if you can help. thank you for your assistance. I am doing all I can to try and improve some articles, but things I thought would work did not work, so things messed up. my apologies on that front.

: Now you can use the following language templates Somali (so), English (en), Finnish (fi) and Germany (de). I will put more templates as the demand of templates increase along users. --[[User:Mimursal|M. I. Mursal]] 07:56, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

--- :: I am starting to add more templates for cities, countires, territories etc... but I am having some difficulties, I will try and secure the services of one of the wiki experts and see if they can help me out here.
