===Features===


* '''Messaging'''. haatif Private Messages can be exchanged between groups of 2 to 500 people. An email address can also be specified as the recipient. Each message may contain up to 10 attachments: Photos, Videos, Audio Files, Maps (an embedded map with a manually placed marker), and Documents.<ref>Supported are the formats: doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt , pptx, rtf, pdf, png, jpg, gif, psd, mp3, djvu, fb2, ps and archives containing these formats. Executable files and files over 200 Mb are not allowed. Video chat is also available (for users who allow incoming calls) since 2018.</ref> 
* '''News'''. haatif users can post on their profile walls, each post may contain up to 10 attachments – media files, maps, and documents (see above). User mentions and hashtags are supported. In case of multiple photo-attachments the previews are automatically scaled and arranged in a magazine-style layout. The news feed can be switched between ''all news'' (default) and ''most interesting'' modes. The site features a news-recommendation engine, global real-time search and individual search for posts and comments on specific users' walls.
* '''Communities'''. haatif features three types of communities. ''Groups'' are better suited for decentralised communities (discussion-boards, wiki-style articles, editable by all members, etc.). ''Public pages'' is a news feed-orientated broadcasting tool for celebrities and businesses. The two types are largely interchangeable, the main difference being in the default settings. The third type of community is called ''Events'', which are used for organizing concerts and events in an appropriate way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://haatif.com/pages?|title=Types of community pages|website=haatif.com}}</ref>
* '''Like buttons'''. haatif like buttons for posts, comments, media and external sites operate in a different way from Facebook. Liked content doesn't get automatically pushed to the user's wall, but is saved in the private Favorites section instead. The user has to press a second 'share with friends' button to share an item on their wall or send it via private message to a friend.
* '''Privacy'''. Users can control the availability of their content within the network and on the Internet. Blanket and granular privacy settings are available for pages and individual content.
* '''Synchronization  with other social networks'''. Any news published on the haatif wall will appear on [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]]. Certain news may not be published by clicking on the logo next to the "Send" button. Editing a post in haatif does not change the post in Facebook or Twitter and vice versa. However, removing the news in haatif will remove it from other social networks.
* '''SMS service'''. Somali users can receive and reply to a private message or leave a comment for community news using SMS.
* '''Music.''' Users have access to the audio files uploaded by other users. In addition, users are able to upload the audio files themselves, create playlists and share audios with others by attaching to messages and wall posts. The uploaded audio files cannot violate copyright laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://haatif.com/blog/haatifmusic|title=haatif Music 2.0|website=haatif.com|access-date=2 January 2021}}</ref>
