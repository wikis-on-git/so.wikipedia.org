a The Arab race should not be confused with the non-Arab races that also belong to the Arab world . But there are instances in which some non-Arab ethnic groups from the Arab world simultaneously identify with Arab and other non-Arab nationalities through cultural assimilation or [56] an ethnic identity as well as partially Arab communities. .
The Arabs, also known as the Arab people, are an ethnic group and nation that mainly inhabits the Arab world in Western Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa and the islands of the Western Indian Ocean (including the Etihad Al-Qamuri ) .

From the study of Quran , Torah and Bible , it is known that the Arabs are from the descendants of Sam , the son of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him ).

Arab mustaraba
Arab Baida 
These are the old inhabitants of Arabia who are no longer known. Among them are Aad, Thamud, Jadis, Talisam, Amalaq, Umeem, Jurham and Jassim. Most of them died due to the punishment of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala.

These are the ancient Arab people who lived in this country. Among them, the people of Ad and Thamud and apart from them, Amalaqa, Tasam, Jadis, Imam etc. are also important.. These people had established kingdoms from Iraq to Syria and Egypt. These people were the founders of Babylonian and Assyrian empires and ancient civilizations.

History is unable to tell us anything in detail about how these nations were erased from the page.. But now there are revelations from the archeology of Babylon, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq and books are being written.. while the nation of Ad and Thamud. The Holy Qur'an tells us that when these nations exceeded the limit in their disobedience and disobedience to Allah, they were surrounded by the punishment of God and they were annihilated.

Arabic Arabic 
They are the inhabitants of Yemen and its vicinity and are called Banu Qahtan . Banu Jarham and Banu Yarab are their branches. Among the Banu Ya'rabs, Abd-i-Shams, known as Saba'i, is the ancestor of all the tribes of Yemen. It was he who built the famous city of Mu'arib in Yemen and built a huge dam there between three hills. In this dam, the water of many springs used to irrigate the fields and gardens of high places.

This dam was weakened and broke after some time due to which there was a huge flood in the whole country. This flood has been mentioned in the Holy Quran and is also present in Arab stories and poems. Most of the families of Yemen were destroyed by this flood and moved to different places.

Arab Arabs are also called Banu Qahtan.. They are the descendants of Sam bin Nuh, the son of Hazrat Nuh (peace be upon him), and these people settled here after the destruction of ancient Arabia (Aad Thamud etc.) and being wiped out from the Arabian peninsula. .

Qahtan was the grandson of Hazrat Nuh (peace be upon him), after whom these people were called Banu Qahtan.. At first these people settled in the region of Yemen. Then there came a period when Banu Qahtan had to migrate to other parts of the Arabian land. So we had to turn to other areas.. This flood is also mentioned in the Holy Quran..

And the second reason is that when their population expanded, their various tribes had to leave Yemen and find new areas for themselves. As a result, these people spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The tribes also went to the border areas of Syria, Iran and Arabia and established their settlements there.. while a tribe of Banu Jarham went to Makkah and Hazrat Hajra, the wife of Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon him) because of the fountain of Zamzam. He settled there with the permission of Anha.

The leader of Azad, a tribe of Banu Qahtan, Thaalba came with his tribe to Yathrib (Madinah) and defeated the few families of Bani Israel who lived here.. built forts and planted oases.. The Khazraj were two famous tribes of Madinah whose history is very high in Islam.

The original cradle of Qahtani Arabia was Yemen. It was here that their families and clans branched off, spread and grew. Two of these clans gained great fame.

(A) Hamir. . The famous branches of which are Zayd Al Jamhoor, Qadaa and Saja Suk.

(b) Kahlan. . The famous branches of which are Hamdan, Anmar, Tay, Mazajj, Kanda, Lakhm, Jazam, Azd, Aus, Khazraj and the descendants of Jaffa, who went on to establish a kingdom around the country of Syria and became known as Al Ghassan.

The general Kehlani tribes later left Yemen and spread to different parts of the Arabian Peninsula. The event of their general desertion happened a little before the Sale of Urum when the Romans occupied Egypt and Syria and established their control over the maritime trade route of the people of Yemen and plundered the facilities of the Burri highway to increase their pressure on them. The trade of the so-called Khalanis was destroyed due to the increase in value. It is no wonder that there was a rift in the Kehlani and Hamiri families and this also became an effective reason for the Kehlanis to leave their homeland. This is also indicated by the fact that the Kehlani tribes left their homeland, but the Hamiri tribes remained in their place.

The so-called tribes who left their homeland can be divided into four categories.

1. Azad. . He left the country on the advice of his chief Imran bin Amr Muziqiyyah. At first, they moved from one place to another in Yemen and sent expeditions to find out the situation, but finally they turned to the north and then the various branches moved around and settled permanently in different places. . Its description is as follows.

Tha'alba bin Amr: He first went to the Hijaz and settled between Tha'albiyah and Dhu Waqar. When his children grew up and the family became strong, he migrated to Madinah and made it his homeland. From the same family of Thaalba are Aus and Khazraj, who are the sons of Haritha, the son of Thaalba.

Harithah Bin Amr: That is, Khuza'ah and his descendants. These people first roamed the land of Hijaz and pitched their tents in Marra-Zahran, then they stormed the Haram and expelled Banu Jarham and settled in Makkah.

Imran bin Amr: He and his descendants settled in Oman, so these people are called Azd Oman.

Nasr bin Azad: The tribes belonging to him settled in Tahamah. These people are called Azd Shinwat.

Jaffna bin Amr: He turned to the country of Syria and settled there along with his children. This person is the ancestor of the Ghassan kings. They are called Al-Ghassan because they stayed for some time at a spring called Ghassan in Hijaz before moving to Syria.

2- Leprosy and leprosy. . . . . Among these Lakhmis was Nasr bin Rabiyyah, who is the ancestor of Shahan Al-Munzar of Hira.

3- Be Banu Tay. . . . . This tribe turned north after the desertion of Banu Azd and settled permanently around two hills called Aja and Salma. Even these two hills became famous because of the Tay tribe.

4- Engraved. . . . These people first Bahrain. . The current Al-Ahsa. . I camped there, but I was forced to leave there and went to Hazrat Alamut, but there was no peace there either, and finally I had to camp in Najd. Here they established a great government, but this government did not prove to be durable and its traces soon disappeared.

Apart from Kahlan, only one tribe of Hamir is Qadaa. . And it's also different to be cute. . . . . . Who left Yemen and settled in Badia Samawa in the borders of Iraq. (1)

Arab Mustaraba 
They are the inhabitants of Hijaz and Najd etc. and are among the descendants of Hazrat Ismail (peace be upon him ). There are many tribes among them, Rabi'a and Muzar are famous. Quraysh is also a branch of Muzhar, in which the Prophet of Arabia (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is related. The Arabs of Mustaraba are also called Banu Adnan .

Banu Ismail was the last to settle on the land of Arabia.. They are also called Arab Mustaraba.. On the command of Allah, Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon him) took his wife Hazrat Hajra and his infant son Hazrat Ismail (peace be upon him) to Mecca. And settled in the Gaya Valley.. and went back by himself..

It should be remembered that at that time there was neither the population of Makkah nor the existence of the Kaaba. The Kaaba was built at the time of Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him). Hazrat Ismail (peace be upon him) was 15 years old when Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon him) came to Makkah and together, both father and son rebuilt the Kaaba on the same foundations under the command of Allah and under the guidance and supervision of Hazrat Gabriel (peace be upon him). On which Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him) was once built

Arab who? 
In Islam, this matter has not been interpreted as to who is an Arab, but in the Holy Quran , it is said:

"An Arab has no superiority over an Ajami (non-Arab) except through piety" from the hadiths of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) it is known that a person is an Arab who speaks the Arabic language.

Genetically an Arab is a person whose ancestors lived in the Arabian Peninsula or the Syrian Desert .

Politically, a person is called an Arab who is a resident of a country where Arabic is the national language or a country that is a member of the Arab League .

Religion 
The religion of the majority of Arabs is Islam and Christians are in the minority, while Arab Jews are also found. Arab Muslims belong to Sunni , Shia , Alevi Ismaili and other sects. Arab Christians belong to Middle Eastern churches, including Coptic, Maronite, Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic.

Before the advent of Islam, most of the Arabs worshiped idols and their major idols included Hubl, Lat, Manat and Uzi. A few tribes believed in Christianity and Judaism, but there were also a few Hanifs who believed in monotheism.

Today, the majority of Arabs follow Sunni Islam, and the Shia are in Bahrain , southern Iraq , areas adjacent to Saudi Arabia , southern Lebanon , areas of Syria , northern Yemen , southern Iran , and the hinterland of Oman .
