Haddii aa rabto in aa noqoto [[wikipedia: Maamulaha|maamulaha]], waa ku saxsantahay in aa imaatay meeshaan. Qof kasto oo meeshaan wax ku darsado waxoo xaq u leeyahay in oo noqdo maamulaha. Sida aad ku noqonasid maamulaha waa sidaan. Isticmaalada kale waa in aa taageero ka heshaa, waa in ee kugu taageeraan maamulnimada ama wixii aad codsaneesid. Markii aa taageero ka heshid waxaa imaanaayo isticmaale ah [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]], waa isticmaale awood u leh in oo dadka ka dhigo maamule, wuuna diidi karaa haddii aa codeynta ku guul dareesatid.

I want to apply sysop to improve areas that need improvement such as [[MediaWiki:Edittools]] and [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets|gadgets]] because If you do not have the capability Sysop you can't do anything.

thanks

:This user's plans with the titleblacklist (see [[MediaWiki talk:Titleblacklist]] and [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]]'s history (where the proposed changes were implemented by another admin) don't make me think it would be a good idea to trust this user with sysop access as of now. I expect some clarification from his side before. Though, please note that I am not involved in the sowiki community. [[User:Vogone|Vogone]] [[Meta:SWMT|(SWMT)]] 08:50, 28 Abriil 2014 (UTC)

:The suggested edit and response to title blacklist is a little of a concern. Such edits should be very specific, not so loose, and need to be considered in the overall sense, not local only. [[User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]] ([[User talk:Billinghurst|talk]]) 10:20, 30 Agoosto 2014 (UTC)

Hello [[User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]], I explained that case for [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] and you can follow from  [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Steward_requests/Permissions/2014-08#Abshirdheere.40SoWiki here] my responsibility is greater than that any fears of sabotage such as title blacklist, these days people judge the wrong because they don't control what you mean.
Anyway if something means mistake is misunderstanding. After [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] what he advised me, not done anything in the blacklist so what is new?

Thank you
