== Af Soomaali ==

Waan idin salaamay,

Magacayga waa Maxamed I. Mursal waxaana ahay nin soomaali ah oo ku nool dalka Finland. Waxaan diyaar u ahay in aan wax ka geysto horumarinta bogan (wikipedia) afka soomaaliga ku qoran. Marka ugu horeysa waxaan tarjumilahaa bogagga hore si ay u soo korodho dadka maqaalada soo qora iyo dadka aqristaba. Hadii uu jiro qofkale oo ku hadla luqada soomaaliga oo raba in uu howshan waxka qabto waxaan ku dhiiri gelinlahaa in uu isa soo bandhigo.

Mahadsanidiin,
Mohamed I. Mursal

Hi, 

My name is Mohamed I. Mursal and I am Somali native speaker who would like to contribute into the Somali wikipedia so.wikipedia.org. 
My first job will be to translate the wiki interface in order to attract more Somali language editors and users. About a week ago I e-mailed info at wikipedia dot org to ask the contact of the only sysop of the Somali wiki. 

If there is another native speaker who is willing to do this job (sysop) then I will encourage coming forward, since we need some one to take responsibility for the administrative tasks of this site.

Thank you, --[[User:Mimursal|M. I. Mursal]] 22:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC) Mohamed I. Mursal

# I support Mimursal's bid to become an admin on the Somali Wikipedia, seeing the lack of leadership elsewise existant on the project. While I don't know Somali, so I can't officially say he's doing a good job, I can assume his contributions are valid based on his edit histories and his communications with me.  --  [[User:Zanimum|Zanimum]] 14:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
