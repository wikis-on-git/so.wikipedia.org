| RHT
| West Ukraine was LHT, like most of former Austria-Hungary. [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] remained LHT as part of Czechoslovakia before switching in 1941 as part of Hungary. The rest of Ukraine, having been part of the [[Russian Empire]], already drove on the right.<br>Some sections of [[Kryvyi Rih Metrotram]] use LHT due to tramcars have doors only on right side, which makes it impossible to use RHT at stations with island platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mqng0q_pWI|title=Криворожский скоростной трамвай|first=|last=Vril|date=13 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>
